# Design Contribution templates read me

Here you will find an English folder and a Chinese folder.

There are templates for each language included in these folders. These templates were created by [Superbloom.design](https://superbloom.design/) and translated by [Tofus](https://x.com/tofuswang). They are some of what we think are 'good' design contributions to OSS projects.

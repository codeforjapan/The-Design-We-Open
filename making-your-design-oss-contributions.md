# Making your design OSS contributions

A lot of these tools are very complex if you don't know them in detail. The most important part of this workshop was starting the process of a design contribution to these OSS issues.

Your work and insight can now be used to improve many OSS tools and help OSS projects become ready for design contributions.

## How to make a contribution

A contribution doesn't have to be BIG to be a very good contribution - comments, discussion, ideas and sketches can be awesome contributions too - don't be hard on yourself if you have a short or simple contribution as your first contribution or future contributions. The important thing is that you are involved and helping improve the OSS :).

For this workshop we are recommending:
1. Spend time understanding the OSS tool you work on as a group
2. Understand user needs from the [User Research we've made available]()
3. 


## Here the suggested issues/tasks to contribute to as part of the COSCUP Workshop:


### The issues: CENO Browser
1. New users may not be aware of how they can exercise their data and privacy rights or users may also forget this over time, hence, making this information available at various touch-points is important to keep users aware of their privacy related consent and choices.

2. Add a set of crawled websites on Ceno homepage

Ceno crawls and creates a backup of a few websites that risk being blocked or censored in some regions so that users can access that content.

### The issues: Session App
1. When activists and human rights advocates want to share URLs they can often be in a time sensitive situation. Some URLs contain tracking codes on them when copied from other platforms and services and we'd like to make sure users know what these are, how to remove them and why. https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/issues/1429
Connected to this issue is also the issue of notifying users when media is shared directly (or indirectly) from a chat session.https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/issues/1441 & https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/issues/602
2. Users in extreme and risky circumstances often delete and start new chats, with new user names or log off and delete apps like Session for periods of time where they may have their device searched or seized. Helping session users recover their previous chats via a unique code and username is critical UX - how can we better communicate and facilitate this in the application? https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/issues/1348


### The issues: Cofacts
1. How can users looking at long texts and references get a clear picture of the thread and specifically differentiate two references https://github.com/cofacts/rumors-site/issues/360
2. How to improve analytics views of Cofacts for understanding and comprehension of what the 'viewership' of readers are?https://github.com/cofacts/rumors-site/issues/332 https://g0v.hackmd.io/yEp9JJtHSyK18bxCQV4dUg#Analytics

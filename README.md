# The-Design-We-Open
Welcome to the repository for the Open Design workshops at [COSCUP](https://coscup.org/) Conference. Design for Internet Shutdowns and Internet Freedom.

## 2024 Workshop

### What the workshop aims for
This workshop will bring together participants from diverse backgrounds, including designers, developers, product managers, and documentation writers, to collaboratively address issues in civic tech, privacy, security, and human rights-focused OSS tools.

The workshop is structured to ensure that participants, especially those new to OSS contributions, can effectively engage and make impactful design contributions. It will feature a series of guided activities and exercises, focusing on user research and usability needs identified in existing OSS projects. The event is hosted by Superbloom staff, experienced in design, UI/UX, product management, community engagement, and documentation work in OSS. Their expertise will provide participants with the necessary support and guidance throughout the workshop.

Key objectives of the workshop include:

- Demystifying non-code contributions: Educating participants on how to translate developer issues into design briefs and make meaningful design contributions to OSS projects.
- Facilitating hands-on contributions: Ensuring each participant makes a tangible design contribution to an OSS project by the end of the workshop.
- Promoting ongoing engagement: Providing resources and documentation to encourage continued contributions from designers to OSS projects post-workshop.

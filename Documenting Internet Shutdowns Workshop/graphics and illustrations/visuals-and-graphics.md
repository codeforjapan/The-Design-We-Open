### Design philosophy

1. This design idea blends the essence of Taiwan’s diverse culture, showcasing a unique fusion of tradition and modernity through four characters of different ages:

- **Top left woman:** She wears a _lucky charm_ inspired by Taiwan's temple symbols, representing protection, blessings, and peace, reflecting Taiwan's deep religious and spiritual background.
- **Top right girl:** Her overall look is inspired by the _school uniforms of Taiwanese junior school students_, symbolizing the youthful energy of Taiwan.
- **Bottom left elderly man:** He wears a traditional _Taiwanese flag hat_, carries a _"Taiwanese Bag,"_ and holds a cup of iconic bubble tea, representing the older generation's strong cultural roots and love for Taiwan’s classic food.
- **Bottom right boy:** He wears a _"Fude Zhengshen"_ necklace, a symbol of wealth and protection, paired with a modern tank top, and uses floral patterns to represent freedom and inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community, showcasing Taiwan's acceptance of diverse cultures and gender equality.
This design not only highlights the depth and inclusiveness of Taiwan’s multicultural identity but also reflects the Taiwanese people's respect for tradition and openness to modern trends. Each character is not just a cultural symbol but also a messenger of the Taiwanese spirit.

### Design philosophy

1. This design idea blends the essence of Taiwan’s diverse culture, showcasing a unique fusion of tradition and modernity through four characters of different ages:

- **Top left woman:** She wears a _lucky charm_ inspired by Taiwan's temple symbols, representing protection, blessings, and peace, reflecting Taiwan's deep religious and spiritual background.
- **Top right girl:** Her overall look is inspired by the _school uniforms of Taiwanese junior school students_, symbolizing the youthful energy of Taiwan.
- **Bottom left elderly man:** He wears a traditional _Taiwanese flag hat_, carries a _"Taiwanese Bag,"_ and holds a cup of iconic bubble tea, representing the older generation's strong cultural roots and love for Taiwan’s classic food.
- **Bottom right boy:** He wears a _"Fude Zhengshen"_ necklace, a symbol of wealth and protection, paired with a modern tank top, and uses floral patterns to represent freedom and inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community, showcasing Taiwan's acceptance of diverse cultures and gender equality.
This design not only highlights the depth and inclusiveness of Taiwan’s multicultural identity but also reflects the Taiwanese people's respect for tradition and openness to modern trends. Each character is not just a cultural symbol but also a messenger of the Taiwanese spirit.

### Design philosophy

This design draws inspiration from the iconic Taiwanese taxi drivers, capturing the essence of the city's vibrant street culture through intricate details:

1. [The Taxi Driver](https://www.businesstoday.com.tw/article/category/80392/post/201107280015/): Dressed in the classic red jacket, a signature look of Taiwanese taxi drivers.
2. Interior Decorations: Inside the taxi, a statue of Taiwan’s deity, [the God of Wealth](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%B2%A1%E7%A5%9E), sits on display, representing blessings for safe travels and prosperity. [Hanging gold ingot](https://9999k.com.tw/%E9%8A%80%E9%A3%BE%E7%9F%A5%E8%AD%98/2780.html) charms further enhance the theme of good fortune and financial success. 
3. Traditional Taxi Equipment: The taxi is equipped with a [dispatch machine](https://www.supamoto.com.tw/products/-supamoto-%E5%A4%A7%E8%81%B2%E5%85%AC-%E5%96%87%E5%8F%AD-%E5%96%8A%E8%A9%B1-%E6%93%B4%E9%9F%B3-%E8%AD%A6%E8%BB%8A-%E6%95%91%E8%AD%B7%E8%BB%8A-%E8%AD%A6%E7%AC%9B-%E6%B0%A3%E7%AC%9B-%E8%9D%B8%E7%89%9B-%E8%AD%A6%E5%A0%B1-%E6%95%91%E9%9B%A3-%E6%B1%BD%E7%AC%9B-%E5%85%AD%E9%9F%B3-6%E9%9F%B3) that displays real-time job assignments and a radio system for remote communication.

### Design philosophy:

This design draws inspiration from key moments in Taiwan's protest history, reflecting the core values of democracy and freedom:

1. [Sunflower Movement](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%A4%AA%E9%99%BD%E8%8A%B1%E5%AD%B8%E9%81%8B): The movement started as a response to the rushed approval of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement, which protesters believed would harm Taiwan’s economy and increase China’s political influence. The movement also called for better democratic procedures and opposed unfair trade practices.
2. [Liberty Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Square_(Taipei)): Located at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, Liberty Square symbolizes Taiwan’s shift from dictatorship to democracy, ending the KMT's long one-party rule. It has been a central gathering place for protests, where people express their fight for freedom and human rights.

2. [Jet fighters and missiles](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B5%B7%E5%B3%BD%E9%A3%9B%E5%BD%88%E5%8D%B1%E6%A9%9F): These elements reflect the political and military threats Taiwan faces from China, highlighting the frequent use of these tactics as a form of intimidation.

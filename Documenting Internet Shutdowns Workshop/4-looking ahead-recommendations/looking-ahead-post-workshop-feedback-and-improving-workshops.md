# Looking ahead: Post Workshop Feedback and Improving workshops

During workshops at [COSCUP 2023](https://coscup.org/2023/en/) (and in [COSCUP 2024](https://coscup.org/2024/en/)) we received actionable feedback from participants. We’ve turned these into recommendations for future workshops.

## Recommendation #1 - Grounding Design exploration in reality

Design exploration activities are useful for those that know those practices (Designers typically) and those that don’t (Activists and OSS Technologists). These are activities like User Persona ([Resource 1](https://superbloom.design/resources/persona-template-tech.pdf) and [Resource 2](https://superbloom.design/resources/superbloom-threat-modeling-template.pdf)), User Scenario and Journey Mapping ([Resource 1](https://superbloom.design/resources/superbloom-user-journey-mapping-template.pdf)) and Ideation activities ([Resource 1](https://www.designkit.org/methods/rapid-prototyping.html) and [Resource 2](https://www.designkit.org/methods/storyboard.html)). However, when you explore design without a clear grounding in the realities of the software and tool landscape people become prone to ‘blue sky thinking’ ideas that are beyond current or possible technical realities. Time spent focusing on short but clear tool demos and landscapes in the workshop allows participants to apply design explorations to existing technology tools/OSS. 


## Recommendation #2 - Including OSS maintainers in workshops

OSS is typically open and accessible to anyone for contributions; designers and coders don’t need permission to submit improvements but it often feels like you need to ask before offering design. When you involve OSS maintainers and OSS founders in a workshop they are able to communicate any vision or goals they have for the OSS, as well as communicating any user needs they may know. Additionally, the designers get the opportunity to see the OSS in action if the maintainers can do demos. 

## Recommendation #3 - Including activists in workshops

The presence of people with lived experience of human rights abuses and internet censorship/shutdowns is important to designers, technologists and OSS developers alike. When workshop participants get ‘stuck’ on a particular point, question or circumstance they can look to the person with experiences to offer perspective and their own account. As an informational resource people with lived experience can quickly feel exploited and vulnerable when offering information and therefore we recommend the safest ways to involve these people possible be it remotely, funded in-person attendance and anonymous representation or representative information. We encourage offering access and further value to the activists or communities in the form of involvement in the OSS.

## Recommendation #4 - Design confidence, feedback and designing within systems of oppression

Participants found significance in the processes of feedback between designers. Many designers at the workshop, and in OSS generally, do not get to work closely with other designers (groups of designers are even rarer!) so found the support and feedback process invigorating and valuable to their careers beyond the workshop. The second implicit effect feedback has, is to build confidence and capability in tackling OSS and Internet Freedom topics by designers which can benefit both OSS and Internet Freedom and proprietary, commercial and for-profit spaces, enabling them to design within systems of oppression.

## Recommendation #5 - 2 day workshops with specific focuses 
Participants of the 2023 workshop that also attended the 2024 workshop noted that they felt like these were two halves of a single workshop spread out a year apart. They value the day of design thinking exercises at 2023’s workshop and the more practical ‘make a contribution’ focus of 2024’s workshop (Read more here on our blog). We recommend that workshops are a minimum of 2 days, one day to focus on design and user exploration and the second to ensure a tangible contribution is made. These days don’t need to both be in person or close together but should ideally happen between 2 weeks and 1 month of each other.

## Recommendation #6 - Design legitimacy and further learning in OSS
Designers are more commonly working in sectors that don't understand open source software contributions as valuable work experience and how some designers choose to advance their design skills. The designers in attendance wanted certification/a certificate for being involved in the workshop, and also expressed wanting a curriculum or educational course they could follow from OSS design experts in order to become more proficient in design for OSS and internet freedom.

## Recommendation #7 - Small-scale support for prototypes
The technologists and coders in the workshop wanted to be able to spend time building or coding the solutions prototyped in the workshop and test whether or not they solved the problems they intended to. Offering small scale funding to build and test a prototype technology can help to build infrastructure for on-going involvement in developing OSS Internet Freedom technology, design in OSS Internet Freedom technology and supporting the post workshop enthusiasm beyond the moment.

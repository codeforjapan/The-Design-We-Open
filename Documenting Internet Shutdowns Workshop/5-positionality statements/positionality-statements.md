# Positionality statements

Codenames for the researchers are: Nutmeg, Soybean, Cocoa, X and X

## What are your beliefs about Taiwan, OSS and Internet Freedom?

**Nutmeg:** My beliefs about Taiwan before these workshops was that, as a country, Taiwan was under threat from China in social, political and societal ways. I believed that Taiwan was in a disadvantageous position when it came to fighting or resisting these threats and while the potential risks are complex, Taiwan is incredibly capable, strong and advanced in Internet Freedom Technologies. 

**Soybean:** I believe Taiwan is part of the human world, and the internet serves as a tool for us to communicate and connect as individuals. The internet is an important infrastructure in our network history, akin to highways, railways, and air routes today. Although maintaining these infrastructures comes at a cost, as humans who thrive through collaboration, ensuring the free and open access to the internet is crucial for uniting people. This relies on the collective efforts of individuals across different nations. Open-source software is one of the means to promote internet freedom by developing tools and sharing solutions that ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate in collaboration and technological advancement. Since humans make mistakes, self-correcting mechanisms are essential in every context, and open-source software is one form of self-correction in technology.

**Cocoa:** I have learnt a lot more about Taiwan and its Internet Freedom and OSS space during the workshops than before. My impressions of the country have mainly been about its strong semiconductor industry, progressive policies and threat from ROC. I have come to learn more about Taiwan’s complex need for Internet Freedom tech for various political and geographical reasons. I have come to learn of the resilience of its people, their capabilities and the ecosystem it offers to voice and develop innovative solutions.

## What history or personal interaction do you have with Taiwan, OSS and Internet Freedom?

**Nutmeg:** As a British citizen, before doing these workshops, I distantly understood Taiwan within the context of historical British colonialism. My first direct experiences with Taiwan were directly related to open source software and an inclusive attitude towards design as part of how open source software is made better for users.

**Soybean:** Honestly, I don’t know how to code, but with my social science background, I understand that the birth of technology relies on human collaboration, and designing technology requires the involvement of many people to meet the needs of different groups. When I first joined the g0v community, my favorite thing was observing how people used technology. This also influenced my choice to pursue a design career. The people here are generous, always willing to share how they use technology, along with data and source code, and they are also open to feedback on what they share. I love this spirit of openness and open source.

**Cocoa:** While I have experience in OSS and design, I am relatively new to the Internet Freedom space in Taiwan. I approached this workshop as an opportunity to offer my design skills and design experience while learning more about Internet Freedom. I had already worked on a few open source projects mainly targeted for the South Asian context, at the time of joining the workshop. 

## What is your connection to workshop participants? Do you share any commonalities, identities, or experiences with workshop participants?

**Nutmeg:** I planned, applied and facilitated workshops around design in open source software and then internet freedom both in Taiwan for this work and also elsewhere through my career. I share and connect to the dedication that Taiwanese people involved in civic tech and OSS have in regards to open access and freedoms. With the workshop participants I share and remember my earlier days of my design career and how community collaboration events shaped my growth and community connection.

**Soybean:** Many participants, like me, are designers, but they come from diverse backgrounds. Some are also friends from the g0v community. One similarity is that we all enjoy observing human behavior, providing emotional value, and making others feel comfortable and relaxed. In terms of self-identity, I think we all share a desire for everyone to lead a happy life.

**Cocoa:** I share commonalities of experiences with the workshop participants in a broader Asian context. There are a few common cultural and behavioral commonalities such as the work ethics driven by Indian and Taiwanese economies, cuisine etc... Apart from that I shared a common interest for Open Source and Design in tech, with many participants. 


## What are your hopes for Taiwan, OSS and Internet Freedom?

**Nutmeg:** I hope that Taiwanese citizen’s interest and access to open source software and openness continues to grow and gradually becomes more inclusive of design practices in a sustainable way. I also hope that Taiwan never suffers under censorship or shutdown but I believe there is the resilience and knowledge to prepare and mitigate these circumstances should they come to pass.

**Soybean:** I hope Taiwan continues to maintain an open, diverse, and free social environment, allowing creativity, ideas, and technology to thrive. I also hope open-source software becomes a daily tool for more people, embedding the spirit of sharing technology into everyone’s lives and enabling collaboration. As for internet freedom, I hope we can continue to promote open access, allowing more people to freely access information, express their ideas, and use the power of the internet for effective collaboration. This way, we can support each other and face global challenges together. 

**Cocoa:** I hope that Taiwan continues to be a relatively safer space for activists and people in general to fight on the right side of Internet freedom. I hope that the culture of design in tech and open source grows stronger and that there are more diverse communities participating in conferences such as COSCUP.

# Why Design and designers are important for Internet Freedom OSS / 為什麼設計和設計師對於網路自由 OSS 很重要

The enthusiasm that technologists express when speaking about human rights, civic tech and privacy and security tools is admirable. They create and configure these tools, advocate for their use and their continual improvement with a passion that is frequently connected to a very real and intense life experience. Yet when you speak to the users of these tools, ordinary people, not especially technologically experienced, though experienced enough to know that they need these tools in order to stay safe, private and independent you hear the similar passion for human rights sprinkled with moderate to large amounts of frustration. 

- *“Why can’t the privacy settings be more clear and understandable?”*

- *“It’s so difficult to communicate to the people we train in digital privacy that to be safe, they have to switch VPN sometimes. It’s hard to communicate why”*

- *“Well I use these tools for my journalism reporting but, honestly I still use big techs communication tools too, even though I know it’s risky they are easier to use and my family won’t switch to secure tools.”*

Technologists notice these issues from their users as critical usability bugs in their technologies. Here is where designers and their design practices can mitigate problems for users and equalize the access and use of critical human rights and civic technologies. Designers seek to prioritize both expert and novice use of technology.

Designers and their practices bridge the experiences between tool developers and citizen users. It should never be a requirement to fully comprehend the technologies inner workings in order to use it to be safe. Here is the bridge designers and technologists in partnership build to bring users across, towards safe and secure existence and interaction with tech. Designers humanize the needs and purposes of technology in order to make it useful across a spectrum of global daily life experiences. Designers want to, by their very practice, include and make accessible. Designers, when given the opportunity to use design practice to do good, will do good.

Yet the barriers for designers and design practice to be normalized in Internet Freedom OSS technology are great. Design practice often registers as less vital than technological skills. Less budgeted for, less respected, less served by online collaboration platforms yet in design practice is where the interaction between the lived experience of the human meets technology and is humanized. Humanising technology and understanding these high risk, complex human rights defenders experiences is where we find the focus of the design events and hackathons like those hosted at COSCUP.

技術人員在人權、公民科技和隱私安全工具領域的熱忱令人欽佩他們開發並讓這些工具可更加完善，源自於真切而深刻的生活體驗。然而，一般用戶雖然認知到這些工具的必要性，卻常常感到無力：然而，當你與這些工具的普通用戶交談時，你會發現他們對人權同樣熱忱，卻又夾雜著不同程度的無力感。這些用戶雖不精通科技技術，但深知這些工具對保障自身安全、隱私和獨立的重要性。

- 「為何隱私設置不能更直觀？」
- 「向學員解釋為何安全需要時常切換VPN，這很困難」
- 「雖然我在寫稿中使用較具安全性的工具，但日常還是會用一般大品牌的通訊軟體，因為它們更方便，家人也不願改用安全工具。」

這些問題被技術人員視為嚴重的易用性bug。而設計師的專業正能彌補這一問題，讓重要的人權和公民科技工具更易於使用和普及。設計師致力於兼顧專業技術用戶和新手的需求。
設計師搭建了開發者和用戶間的橋樑。擁有較高的安全性不應以完全理解內部運作的技術為前提。設計師和技術專家合作，引導用戶在具安全隱私保護性下地與科技互動。他們將技術需求人性化，使之適應全世界各種日常場景。設計師的核心理念是包容性和普遍性，他們渴望通過設計實踐造福社會。
然而，設計在網路自由開源軟體領域的重要性仍未得到充分認可。與技術技能相比，設計實踐常被視為次要，獲得的資源和重視度較低。但正是在設計中，人類經驗與技術相融，實現了人性化。理解高風險、複雜的人權捍衛者的需求，正是COSCUP等設計活動和黑客松的核心。

# Why COSCUP is an important event for Internet Freedom OSS / 為什麼 COSCUP 是網路自由 OSS 的重要活動

COSCUP is one of the biggest and important international open source events in Taiwan. It receives a high number of participants interested not only in tech but also design which makes it a great spot for discourse from critical perspectives of people involved in building solutions for internet freedom i.e. technologists and designers. COSCUP is also very welcoming and offers flexibility in tailoring workshops and discussions around open source and internet freedom topics. 

COSCUP, being held in Taiwan, also offers a neutral or rather a more positive space (geographically) with a freedom of speech and freedom of press to talk and spread ideas concerning sensitive topics such as the human rights especially those of the marginalized communities who are most in need of internet freedom tools and technologies to protect their privacy and security digitally. There are also other organizations and individuals in Taiwan working on complex issues of human rights  and building civic technologies. If anything, there needs to be a greater involvement among such persons. Most countries surrounding Taiwan may not offer the same level of freedom. This makes COSCUP an important event for internet freedom OSS in South East Asia and broader parts of Asia. 

The need for privacy, security and finding ways to stay connected as a community in the face of internet instability is also very real for the Taiwanese. They recognize their relationship with CCP, they understand the natural calamity can impact their infrastructure and hence believe in staying prepared. From our experience of running workshops in COSCUP, these have been key problem areas that the participants chose to design their solutions for. 

COSCUP 是台灣最大且最重要的國際開源活動之一，吸引了大量不僅對技術感興趣，還對設計感興趣的參與者。這樣的參與者組成使 COSCUP 匯聚了技術人員、設計師等，提供了一個絕佳的平台。讓他們能從不同的角度進行深入討論。此外，COSCUP 也非常友善且有彈性， 以「開源」與「網路自由」為核心，來設計工作坊與研討會議程。

COSCUP 在台灣舉辦，提供了一個更中立或更積極的空間（地理位置上），在這裡享有言論自由和新聞自由，可以討論和傳播有關敏感議題的想法，如人權問題，尤其是那些最需要網路自由工具和技術來保護其數位隱私和安全的弱勢群體。台灣還有其他組織和個人在致力於解決複雜的人權問題和開發公民科技。事實上，這些人之間需要有更高度的參與與機會合作。先對於周邊國家，台灣提供了相對開放的環境，使 COSCUP 成為東南亞及更廣泛亞洲地區網路自由與開源軟體領域的指標性會議。

對於台灣人來說，深切感受到網路不穩定的影響，同時對個人隱私與安全存有高度的關注。他們清楚認知與中國共產黨的關係，並理解自然災害可能會影響其基礎設施，因此注重做好準備。根據我們在 COSCUP 舉辦工作坊的經驗，這些問題一直是許多參與者選擇設計解決方案的核心重點。

**“Speculating on a ‘war situation’ we Taiwanese think that Taiwan would go through circumstances similar to the Russo-Ukrainian War with actual military intervention...China has already employed cognitive warfare strategy, through disinformation, military intimidation, and influence operations for many years.” - Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

# # Taiwan's relationship to internet freedom and OSS / 台灣的網路自由與開源軟體現狀

*What are the threats to internet freedom in Taiwan and what do regular people and technologists think about internet freedom?*

Taiwan is widely recognized for its high level of internet freedom, ranking sixth globally and first in Asia according to Freedom House's 2023 report. With an internet penetration rate of 90.7% as of January 2024, Taiwanese citizens view internet access as a fundamental right. This freedom has fostered a vibrant civic tech community that collaborates with the government to promote transparency and openness.

However, Taiwan faces unique challenges to its internet freedom. The country is on the frontline of China's "Cognitive Warfare," which includes disinformation campaigns, military intimidation, and influence operations. These threats have put pressure on Taiwan's online information ecosystem, potentially manipulating public opinion and threatening the integrity of its digital spaces.
The open source software (OSS) community in Taiwan has responded to these challenges by developing locally-focused projects. Many of these initiatives, like the fact-checking bot Cofacts, are designed to address Taiwan-specific issues and are deeply integrated into popular local platforms. While this approach effectively serves the Taiwanese context, it can make these tools difficult to replicate in other countries.

台灣的網路自由度享譽全球，在自由之家2023年報告中位列全球第六、亞洲第一。截至2024年1月，台灣網路普及率高達90.7%，全民視網路使用權為基本權利。這樣的自由環境孕育了蓬勃的公民科技社群，與政府攜手推動政策透明度和開源開放。

然而，台灣面臨獨特的挑戰。作為抵禦中國「認知戰」的最前線，台灣須應對包括假訊息傳播、軍事威脅和影響力操作等威脅。這些因素不僅衝擊台灣的網路，還可能影響公眾輿論，危及數位空間的完整性。
為應對這些挑戰，台灣開源（OSS）社群積極開發本土專案。如事實查核機器人Cofacts等項目，專門針對台灣特有問題設計，並與本地主流平台深度整合。這種方法雖然在台灣環境中有亮眼的成效，但可能難移植到其他國家。

# What is the purpose of this Document?

As it would be apparent from the above sections, Superbloom conducted a workshop at COSCUP in 2023 on the topic of ‘Designing for Human Rights and Internet Freedom OSS’. This workshop brought together different kinds of contributors (developers, engineers, designers and OSS enthusiasts etc.) to utilize design practices, methods and research to explore the topic of internet shutdowns and censorship in Taiwan and how OSS technology can be used and improved from their perspectives. During the workshop, the participants developed various artifacts such as -  improved personas, detailed user journey maps, discovering problems and finding solutions to prepare for internet shutdown scenarios. 

The purpose of this report/output is to preserve and present all the artifacts in a structured, translated(in Chinese) and detailed manner along with design experts’ contexts. These outputs are also published on a public GitHub repository so that there’s a continuity with future workshops as opposed to being lost and forgotten. This output includes commentary on how to run similar workshops thereby enabling other design facilitators to learn and recreate them. We hope others will iterate on these resources, reference them in future workshops and build on this work.

In summary, we hope that this will:
- Enhance accessibility and understandability of the workshop artifacts
- Increase knowledge sharing and collaboration on this topic
- Empower other design practitioners
- Increase community engagement and participation
- Lead to productive solutions that benefits people in need

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Introduction and framing the workshop / 工作坊的介紹與框架

When beginning the workshop, there must be a welcoming and inviting feeling. Many designers have not experienced the Free and Open Source (FOSS or OSS) space or gained much experience with the Internet Freedom, Human rights technology or censorship circumvention technology space. The OSS and Human Rights technology space share many commonalities and the development and coding practices are familiar to each other, but design in both these spaces are rare. Ensure that workshop participants are welcome to bring their own thoughts, critique and experience as well as asking detailed and basic questions is welcome.
This workshop can be attended by designers, coders, developers, technologists and those interested in OSS or involved in OSS. It's also good for journalists, human rights defenders, civic technologists or people who work at NGOs or charities that are committed to a non-political/non-partisan, human rights inclusive approach. People involved in 'Big Tech', surveillance technology or who are politically aligned can also join these workshops, especially if they are openly accessible and available, but the framing of the workshop should be clearly communicated that we are prioritizing privacy, security and digital human rights globally with this work.


工作坊應以營造友善和歡迎的氛圍為首要任務。許多設計師可能對自由開源軟體（FOSS 或 OSS）、網路自由、人權科技或反審查技術等領域尚感陌生。雖然 OSS 和人權科技領域在開發和寫code實踐上有諸多相似之處，但這兩個領域內的設計層面的工作仍屬少見。因此，我們需要確保參與者能夠自在地分享想法、提出建議和分享經驗，同時鼓勵他們提出各種問題，無論是細微的還是基本的。
這個工作坊歡迎多元背景的參與者，包括：
1. 設計師、寫code的人、開發者和技術專家
2. 對 OSS 感興趣或已參與 OSS 的人士
3. 記者、人權捍衛者和公民科技工作者
4. 在非政治性/非黨派性、注重人權的非政府組織或慈善機構工作的人員
我們也歡迎來自科技公司、監控技術領域的從業者或具有政治傾向的人士參加，尤其是在工作坊以公開且自由參與的前提下。然而，我們會明確傳達工作坊的核心宗旨：優先考慮全球的隱私、安全和數位人權。

## Facilitators / 引導者

For this workshop, it is important to have some different sectors and expertise present. We recommend local design groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.), OSS designers and/or coders, developers or maintainers of those OSS projects and designers who are experts in the internet freedom, human rights and censorship circumvention technology space. Facilitation should ideally be shared between these groups and done by those who feel most comfortable and able to facilitate in an engaging and clear way towards the designers and technologists participating in the workshop.

工作坊的成功關鍵在於融合多元領域的專業知識。我們建議邀請以下專家：
1. 當地設計社群代表（如 IxDA、Ideo、Ladies that UX 等）
2. OSS 設計師和/或寫code的人
3. OSS 項目的開發者或維護者
4. 網路自由、人權和反審查技術領域的專業設計師
工作坊引導應由這些群體共同分擔，優先選擇能夠以吸引人和清晰方式帶領參與者的人。

_“In the team, most people identified as engineers, one person had some design training but was not currently in a design job role. However, they ended up playing a key facilitation role between the engineer discussions and keeping the focus on the users.”_ **- Sugar from Team Cake**

---

## Open source design experts / 開源設計專家

People who work on or have contributed to OSS generally are valuable participants of this workshop. They are able to give insight and context on OSS culture, communication and expectations across a broad selection of OSS projects. They can also typically operate and use the interfaces and processes needed to contribute to OSS more quickly and effectively than those completely new to these but also can support and teach other participants at the workshop how to use OSS processes and functions e.g. how to submit an issue, how to create a branch, how to install, run and use an OSS project/tool.

OSS 領域的從業者或貢獻者是工作坊的寶貴資產。他們可以：
- 提供 OSS 項目的深入洞見和背景知識
- 分享 OSS 文化、溝通方式和社群期望
- 熟練操作 OSS 貢獻流程和工具
- 指導新手使用 OSS 流程，如提交問題、創建分支、安裝和使用 OSS 項目等

_“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

## Internet freedom tool experts / 網路自由工具專家

These can be designers, technologists or people who have worked/volunteered in the NGO, Internet Freedom, Journalism or Civic Technology space. They offer insight into the complex and nuanced challenges faced by those institutions and individuals doing human rights advocacy and work. The areas of knowledge are broad and it's best to look for people with knowledge in a specific type of human rights depending on the focus of the workshop. For example, our workshop in 2023 focussed on experiences of journalists, researchers and protestors who are at risk of being surveilled as well as targeted with online harassment and violence when they have critical information or attendance at events that may target them as human rights defenders. Along with these types of people we also focussed on when the internet is shut down or when certain information (or access to information) is censored.

這類專家可能來自非政府組織、網路自由、新聞業或公民科技領域，包括設計師、技術專家或其他相關人員。他們的價值在於：
- 深入理解人權倡導工作中的複雜挑戰
- 提供特定人權領域的專業知識
- 分享實際案例和經驗
例如，2023 年的工作坊聚焦於：
1. 記者、研究人員和社運者面臨的風險，如監視、網路騷擾和暴力
2. 網路中斷關閉和訊息審查的應對策略
這樣的專家組合能確保工作坊涵蓋理論和實踐，為參與者提供全面的學習體驗。

_“I appreciated the civic and social focus of the workshop, which contrasts my day job where design must always be monetized for commercial purposes. The most educational part came from the feedback provided by the designers working in Internet Freedom and those with experiences of these complex  Human Rights issues. I found it valuable to directly see how different teams approached the same topic with unique processes and solutions.”_ **- Mint from Team Mojito**

---

## Local design community experts / 本地設計社群專家

Local design expert community groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.) should be present at the workshop to act as experts in design processes and practices but also how these processes and practices are done in the country's local context. We should not assume that design processes are the same all around the globe.

建議應邀請當地設計社群（如 IxDA、Ideo、Ladies that UX 等）的專家參與工作坊，這些專家不僅熟悉設計流程和實踐，還了解這些流程在本地文化背景中的應用。我們不應假設設計流程在全世界都是一致的。

## Clear planning and agenda in OSS contribution / OSS 貢獻的明確規劃和議程

It's important to enable many forms of engagement in a workshop where you are aiming to investigate open source technology and make contributions. Some participants may want to work on their own machines for privacy and security reasons and also may not be comfortable connecting to insecure internet services. We also made sure that participation via writing and using sticky notes, pens and paper was prioritized. 

These methods often allow for better collaboration, communication and also spreads the risk of who added what detail and when, across a larger group of people. Paper, when digitized carefully can be more anonymous and also can be destroyed more completely than digital files that often leave a traceable trail when interacted with.

We also ensure that setting an agenda with objectives is clear from the beginning. Ensuring that there is the ability to be flexible within these times should participants want less or more time on certain activities and processes. There doesn't need to be very strict times for each activity but allowing for a minimum and a maximum time can help with planning the overall objectives of the workshop.

**The overall objective for this iteration of the workshop were:**
- Map and understand user behaviour during internet shutdowns and crisis
- Understand and explore the OSS tools ecosystem in a Taiwan context
- Ideate how OSS tools can 'fight' internet shutdowns can be designed better for Taiwanese citizens

We advise building in time to have participants that are interested in speaking out loud to the group about progress on ideas and activities that are included in an agenda plan. Sharing ideas out loud when working in smaller groups for a larger event can allow for people to be inspired by others' findings, ideas and processes which can enrich the ideas overall.

主旨在研究和貢獻開源技術的工作坊中，為參與者提供多元的參與方式相當重要。一些參與者可能基於隱私和安全考慮，更希望在自己的裝備上操作，並避免連接到不安全的網路連線。因此，我們將優先考慮非數位化的參與方式，如書寫、便利貼、筆和紙。這些方法不僅能促進更好的協作與溝通，還能在保護隱私的同時分散風險，避免數位足跡的留下。當需要數位化時，我們將謹慎處理紙本資料，以確保其匿名性。

我們將從一開始就明確設置議程和目標，並在時間安排上保持彈性，以便參與者就需要調整各項活動的時間。雖然每項活動不必嚴格限制時間，但設置最短和最長的時限有助於達成工作坊的整體目標。

本次工作坊的主要目標為：
- 繪製並理解用戶在網路中斷和危機期間的行為模式。
- 探索和理解在台灣背景下的 OSS 工具生態系統。
- 設計出適合台灣公民應對網路中斷的 OSS 工具。

我們建議在議程中安排分享環節，讓有興趣的參與者向大家報告進展和想法。這能促進跨組的經驗交流，讓所有人從其他人的結論和觀點中汲取靈感。

## Openness and safety / 開放性與安全性

Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter of this workshop, we make sure to announce that Internet Shutdowns and Human Rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject and that we want participants to be safe. This means that we request participants to be careful with what they say, if they feel like it could put them at risk if shared outside this workshop. Additionally the organizers of the workshop or the participants may want to create their own threat/risk models and threat/risk analysis. This can be a simple written or verbal document that if a topic is discussed they may need to remove themselves from that subject or the entire workshop at that point or that they make sure to use an alias unconnected to their legal identity throughout the workshop. They can also opt out of topics and discussions and let others in the group know (with consent) what the impact could be to them if a certain topic was discussed.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20openness%20and%20safety.jpg)

_Image caption: A screengrab of the slide used in the workshop for openness and safety. The text reads: “Guiding principles and openness of results and anonymisation. Internet Shutdowns and human rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject. We want you to be as safe as possible so we encourage being careful with speaking about what we explore today. Some of these OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that national governments would prefer citizens not to access and share._

Some of the OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that certain institutions, organizations and governments would prefer citizens not to access and share. This is a critical topic to discuss in these kinds of workshops but OSS tools should only be accessed, tested and used on participants' own device if they feel comfortable and not pressured to do so by the group. Alternatively, we recommend bringing test devices with OSS tools pre-loaded on these devices to be used if possible.
We recommend participants to not share insecure contact details with each other, to be careful with disclosing any political opinions or personal details about themselves unless they are very sure that they are safe and can trust the one they're sharing with.
In the absence of experts in any area, participants who feel they have enough insight into those topics can act as experts or those questions and topics can be deferred until post workshop when answers or details can be gathered.

鑑於此次工作坊涉及網路中斷和人權科技這類敏感話題，我們重視參與者的安全。我們將提醒參與者在發言時謹慎考慮，避免透露可能在工作坊外危及自身的資訊。工作坊的組織者和參與者也可以建立自己的避險套路，以便在討論到敏感話題時做出適當的應對，例如退出討論或使用與合法身份無關的別名。
一些 OSS 工具被積極用於促進公民獲取和分享某些敏感資訊，因此，在工作坊中討論這些工具時，應尊重每位參與者的舒適度。如果可能，建議攜帶預裝 OSS 工具的測試設備，以便在需要時進行使用。
為了保障安全，建議參與者避免互相分享不安全的聯繫方式，並在不確定對方可信任度的情況下謹慎透露政治觀點或個人詳細資訊。如果在某些領域缺乏專家，可以邀請熟悉相關主題的參與者暫時擔任專家角色，或者將這些問題留待工作坊後進一步探討。

## Forming groups / 分組

There are many methods that can be used to help people form groups. We recommend that groups be no less than 3 people and no more than 6 when collaborating in a workshop environment on OSS and Internet freedom projects. It's good to encourage participants to spread out the various functions they can perform and insights they can give.
For example, you want to encourage a group to have a 2 / 2 / 2 ratio - 2 designers, 2 OSS technologists/developers and 2 Internet Freedom/NGO insights people. Some people can perform more than one of these roles (e.g. A designer might also work in an NGO or an OSS developer might also have experiences of protests) which is fine. As long as your groups have diverse experience, skills and insights and can communicate and collaborate respectfully, you have a good group.
We try to encourage people to meet new people in these workshops which can be effective in mixing up experiences, perspectives and allows for some skill sharing. We used the 'shopping list' method for mixing up teams - everyone in the room thought of an ingredient for their favorite food or drink. (e.g. 'cheese') and then 1 group leader is picked to say out loud the ingredients that makes their food of choice, out loud they will say 'I need pepperoni!' and if another person chose pepperoni they would join that team. The group leader then keeps saying ingredients for their food until they have 5-6 people and as many ingredients as they can to 'make' that food. The team's name then becomes their food type e.g. 'Team Pizza'.

有許多方式可以協助分組，在以開源軟體和網路自由為主題的工作坊中進行專案協作時，我們建議小組人數介於3到6人之間。推薦鼓勵參與者以他們的能發揮工作項目來提供見解。
例如，你可以鼓勵每組維持2/2/2的比例 ： 2名設計師、2名開源專家/開發人員和2名網路自由//非營利組織顧問 。有些人可以擔任多重角色(例如，設計師也可能在非政府組織工作，或者開源軟體開發人員也可能有參與社運的經驗)，這是可以的。關鍵在於小組擁有多樣化的經驗、技能和見解，並且能夠以互相尊重的方式進行溝通與協作，就可以說是一個理想的小組。
我們試圖鼓勵人們在這些工作坊中結識新朋友，這可以有效地促進經驗、觀點的交流，並有機會讓技能共享。我們採用了"購物清單"的分組方式 - 我們讓每個人都想到他們最喜歡的食物或飲料中的一種配料。(例如「起司」)，接著挑選1位小組組長，請他大聲說出構成他們選擇的食物的配料，他們可能會說：「我需要意大利辣香腸!」如果有人選擇了意大利臘腸，他們就會加入那組。小組組長會繼續喊出食物的配料，直到他們有5-6個人，同時盡可能列舉更多配料來「製作」那道美食。最後，團隊以他們的食物命名，例如「披薩隊」。這種方法不僅能打破陌生感，還能在歡樂的氛圍中自然而然地形成多元化的小組。

## Tool landscape and tool demo / 工具概覽和工具演示

Participants attending the workshops or hackathons might not have in-depth expertise or knowledge about the kinds of tools, users or problems that the workshop hopes to tackle. This expertise is built up during the first half of the workshop from each person in the group sharing what they know with each other but also through the facilitation of the workshop. We kick off the contextual understanding of the workshop with some introductions, demos and explanations of the types of technologies and tools that can be used for the purposes of censorship circumvention and human rights activism. These don't need to be complete, comprehensive demos and you don't need to be an expert or a user of these tools (it helps if you know the basic functionality of the tools you speak about) but fundamentally, letting participants know what exists and what is technologically possible in the space already helps them to better understand the limitations and explorations of what they will investigate later.

參加工作坊或黑客松的參與者可能對工作坊希望運用的工具類型、用戶或議題缺乏深入的專業知識。這些專業知識會在工作坊的前半段透過兩種方式逐步建立：小組成員之間的專業交流，以及工作坊的引導過程。
我們通過介紹、演示和解釋各種可用於規避審查和支援人權社運技術和工具，來開始建立參與者對工作坊背景的理解。這些不需要是完整、全面的，你也不需要成為這些工具的專家或使用者（如果了解所談論的工具的基本功能會更有幫助），重要的是，讓參與者了解這個領域中已有哪些現有的工具及現有的技術的基礎上可能實現什麼，可以方便他們在後續的研究上可以更好的探索。

_“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**


## Destiny

In this workshop we covered a few different technologies, a 'magic wormhole' desktop and mobile app called Destiny (made by Least Authority) that allows users to send files using unique codes that are entered into the app to verify the receiver/sender. The file only sends and receives when both the sender and receiver have the app open on an active connection at the same time. This tool ideally means that sensitive files can be sent more privately with less traceability for people involved.

在這個工作坊中，我們介紹了幾種不同的技術。首先是一個名為 Destiny 的「魔法蟲洞」桌面和移動應用程式（由 Least Authority 開發），它允許用戶使用輸入到應用程式中的唯一代碼來發送文件，以驗證接收者/發送者。只有當發送者和接收者同時在活躍連接上打開應用程式時，文件才會發送和接收。這個工具理想情況下意味著敏感文件可以更私密地發送，參與者的可追蹤性更低。

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. It shows the purple and blue logo for the tool ‘Destiny’, a link to their github project page (https://github.com/LeastAuthority/destiny) and several UI screenshots from the tool showing end-to-end encryption and how devices link to each other to send files. There is a screen of Destiny that has a large button that reads ‘Select a file’ and the next screens progress through sending a file._


## Briar

The second tool we introduced is a communication, messaging and documentation tool called Briar. Briar uses bluetooth technology in short range to connect to other nearby devices that also have Briar and have been through a verification process. This tool is useful for people that need to distribute essential information to pre-approved contacts through a communication method that is harder to 'shut down' (like Wifi and mobile internet). Briar is also able to host longer articles, written text and also multiple people conversations in a 'forum' type function.

我們介紹的第二個工具是 Briar ，這是一款集通訊、訊息和文檔功能於一體的應用程式。Briar 使用短距離藍牙技術連接到附近同樣安裝了 Briar的裝置，這些設備是都經過驗證程序的設備。對於需要向預先認證的聯絡人分發重要訊息的人來說，需要透過更難「中斷」的通訊方式（如 Wi-Fi 和移動網路）這個工具特別有用。Briar 還能夠託管長篇的文章、書面文字，並在「論壇」類型的功能中進行多人對話。

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20tool%20demos%20-%20briar%202.jpg)

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop detailing the tool called ‘Briar’ with the project website https://briarproject.org/ and the green logo. There is an image of a phone with an animation that cycles through the UI of Briar, including the sign in page and how a user would use messaging in Briar._


## New Node

The last tool we introduced is 'New Node' which, similar to Briar, is a peer-to-peer communication tool that is harder to censor or shutdown as it connects directly to other devices with NewNode. Similar to Briar, NewNode can help people in situations where the internet is censored or shutdown make essential communications with trusted people. We also offer a 2 page document with other common tools used in internet shutdowns that participants can investigate when they get time to explore.

我們介紹的最後一個工具是「New Node」，它與 Briar 類似，是一種點對點通訊工具，但更難被審查或中斷，因為它直接連接到其他安裝了 NewNode 的裝置。與 Briar 類似，NewNode 可以協助用戶在網路被審查或中斷的情況下，與信任的人維持必要的的通訊。我們還提供了一份兩頁的文件，列舉了其他在網路中斷時常用的工具，供參與者在有時間研究。

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20newnode%202.jpg)

_Image caption: Two images of the UI of NewNode. The images show a list of contact profile pictures in circles and the message thread previews next to them that shows the most recent message from that message history. The next UI shows a message thread with one person detailing an audio file and an image file being sent as well as fire emojis being used in chat._

Finally, the room was opened up to discuss and write down tools that participants knew of that they anticipated could be useful in internet shutdown scenarios. Even if participants are not familiar with internet shutdowns or other human rights related purposes, they begin to understand the needs and circumstances that people in these human rights situations need and what technology could be useful or fundamental in such scenarios. Participants can either call these out in the room or write their own on stickies and then place them on a common area. In addition to technology or tools it is also helpful to write what it aims to do or achieve, within the human rights context.

最後，我們開放討論，讓參與者寫下他們所知道的、預期在網路中斷狀況下可能用得到的工具。即使參與者不熟悉網路中斷或其他與人權相關的議題，他們開始理解這些在網路中斷或人權相關的情況下人們的需求和處境，以及在這些場景中哪些技術可能有用或甚至發揮關鍵作用。參與者可以在教室裡分享他們的想法，或者將它們寫在便利貼上，然後放在一個公佈欄上。除了技術或工具外，也寫下他們在推動人權議題所希望達成的具體目的和用途。

## Why design is needed in OSS and Internet Freedom tools / 
為什麼開源軟體（OSS）和網際網路自由工具需要設計

One of the main purposes of encouraging designers to participate in OSS and Internet Freedom tool workshops and hackathons is that commonly, these OSS tools and Internet Freedom technologies don't have dedicated design support or design contributions. Hence these tools lack the kind of usability, design and interfaces that regular people expect from technology. They can have difficult to use interfaces, unusual settings, difficult technical language and non-supportive help text or error text. These are just some of the ways in which OSS and Internet Freedom technology can be 'lacking' in terms of design than other commonly used proprietary and commercial technologies and tools.
We focus on showing and communicating the lack of consistent design support for these technologies to help the designers present in the workshop understand the impact they will be able to make on these tools even with limited time in a workshop. Design is an underserved function across OSS and the Internet Freedom space, though there are talented and dedicated designers in the space they can be supported immensely by designers volunteering at events like these workshops. One of the fantastic things about running workshops on these topics around the globe is that these technologies are able to gain perspective from multiple citizens and user perspectives. These OSS internet freedom tools can then be designed with many cultural and contextual scenarios which makes them more usable, relevant and useful world-wide.

鼓勵設計師參與開源軟體和網際網路自由工具的工作坊及黑客松的主要原因，是因為這些工具往往缺乏專業的設計支持與貢獻。由於缺少設計資源，這些工具在可用性、設計和介面上常常難以達到一般使用者對科技產品的期望。它們可能擁有不易操作的介面、不直觀的設定、晦澀難懂的技術語言，以及缺乏說明文字或錯誤的提醒。這些問題使得開源軟體和網際網路自由技術在設計方面，相較於商業專有技術工具存在明顯差距。
我們致力於向工作坊中的設計師展示這些技術在設計上的不足，幫助他們理解即便在工作坊的短暫時間內，他們的設計貢獻也能產生顯著影響。設計在開源軟體和網際網路自由領域是一個被忽視的環節，儘管這個領域中已經有不少才華洋溢且充滿熱情的設計師，但通過這類活動中的志願設計貢獻，可以為他們提供更多的支持。
在全世界舉辦此類主題工作坊的一大優勢在於，可以從不同國家的公民和使用者角度中獲取寶貴的見解。這些開源的網際網路自由工具因此能在設計過程中融入多元的文化和情境，使其在世界各地更具其可用性、相關性和實用性。

_“Internet Freedom and OSS technology is not so easy to use. After the workshop I recognised that some technologies are trying to be implemented for the general public and reduce its relatively high technological entry barrier.”_ **- Taro from Team Hotpot**

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20why%20is%20design%20in%20oss%20important.jpg)

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: “Design in O﻿SS: Why?. Design in OSS is not new by any means! Designers and those that work on the design of OSS tools have been around since the beginning. But they might have called themselves usability experts or maybe HCI (Human computer interaction)Regardless of when designers in FL/OSS started, the trend and increase of interest for design in OSS in the last 5+ years is becoming clearer. Design is mentioned and has a presence across all technology tools in the proprietary or commercial world and more and more organizations and companies are getting on board with the design process and designers as part of technology projects._

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20designers%20are%20users%20advocates.jpg)

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: “Designers are users advocates. Designers are typically focussed on ensuring that the FLOSS's users needs are being met in the way that most works for them. This might not always be a technical answer to a problem, sometimes it's about refining, clarifying and exploring alternate pathways and 'hacks' users use. Designers are there to translate those user needs for the technology they design for. Balancing 'business wants' and stakeholder needs (among other needs and wants!) is the designer's domain._

---

## Personas

Once the tool landscape has been explored, discussed and understood, the next critical component to explore are the users, their needs, threats and experiences. These are critical in order to better understand under what conditions the OSS, Internet Freedom technology will be used. These personas exercises help anyone, designer, developer or human rights activist explore these experiences and helps when making assumptions, asking questions about the users and coming up with hypotheses for use of the technology.
In order to optimize the time in the workshop, the facilitators created 3 user personas based on our own knowledge of similar situations and country contexts. These personas were intended to “spark ideas” and were there to be remixed and edited by workshop participants. This was the first activity the attendees worked on together in their groups. The personas could be read and used by the teams at the workshop as their 'key persona' to design and consider. What we found though, was that the participants in the workshop wanted to analyze and understand these personas, written by people outside Taiwan and then re-contextualise them in a Taiwanese way. Hence, some groups used a majority of a persona’s information and then edited small details. Other groups completely re-wrote their own personas using information from all 3 examples and also information from their own experiences of internet shutdown situations.
These new personas ended up being vital to better understanding the needs and experiences from South East Asian perspectives including folks from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Personas, when used as a device to explore needs, threats and feelings, gives anyone reading them a look at people in certain countries with certain struggles and problems. This is how designers build understanding and empathy for users and can later match technological ideas, features and improvements to goals, needs and threats of personas and then, validate whether those features help solve those problems.

一旦工具已被充分探討、討論並理解後，下一個關鍵步驟是深入探索使用者-他們的需求、面臨的威脅和使用體驗。這些對於更全面地理解開源軟體和網路自由技術將在何種條件下使用至關重要。透過這些人物角色練習有助於設計師、開發者或人權貢獻者，都能更深入地探索這些使用體驗。並做出假設、引導我們詢問更關鍵的使用者問題，並為技術應用提出更有根據的假設。
為了優化工作坊的時間，主持人根據我們對類似情境和國家背景的了解，設計了 3 個代表性的使用者角色。這些角色旨在「啟發想法」，並供工作坊參與者重新組合和編輯。這是與會者在小組中一起進行的第一個活動。工作坊的小組可以將這些預設角色作為參考並以此定調他們的「主要角色」，用於進行設計和討論。
然而，我們發現工作坊的參與者希望分析和理解這些由非台灣人的角色，然後再以台灣的方式重塑角色。因此，有些小組使用了大部分原始的角色資訊，僅對細節進行微調。其他小組則完全徹底的重寫了角色，使用了所有 3 個範例的元素，以及融入了他們對網路中斷情況的經驗。
這些重新設計的角色設定，能讓我們更好地從東南亞視角來理解，使用者的需求和經驗，這是至關重要的，包括來自台灣、香港和中國人的觀點。當角色被用作挖掘使用者的需求、威脅和感受體驗的工具時，它能讓任何理解它們的人了解某些國家中具有特定困境和問題的人。對設計師而言，這是建立對使用者深刻理解和同理心的關鍵途徑。透過深入的洞察後續可以將技術理念、功能特性和改進與角色的目標、需求和威脅相匹配，然後驗證這些功能是否有助於解決這些使用者面臨的問題。

_“As a team we wanted to explore the relationship between Taiwanese citizens and local journalists. The members of this team believe there are two types of journalists. The most common journalist is someone who works to gain views. Then there's also a rarer journalist that informs the public about important social issues, and serves as a watchdog to ensure transparency and accountability while working towards societal solutions.”_ **- Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

## Feedback from users and broader design challenges in the internet shutdowns space / 使用者回饋和網路中斷領域中更廣泛的設計挑戰

Balancing between too much and just enough research on the users, circumstances, experiences and scenarios is tough to measure for every workshop. We included anonymised data to offer deeper insight into user and OSS technology developers/maintainers pain-points and challenges. These included complaints that the OSS technologists had heard from their own user bases such as: "This process is confusing and I don't know if I can trust the people who make the tool and who shows up as my 'friends' there" and consistent challenges like designing technology when the likelihood of a device being 'seized' (taken by police, governments or institutions in order to be searched for any illegal or sensitive information). These prompts add more detail and context to the challenges of designing and developing internet freedom technology and allow the participants to keep in mind these needs.

在每次工作坊中，我們面臨著一個持續的挑戰：如何在有限的時間內，適度地深入研究使用者、他們所處的情境、使用體驗以及可能遇到的各種場景。我們納入了匿名數據，讓我們能夠更深入地洞察使用者以及開源軟體技術的開發者和維護者所面臨的痛點與挑戰。這些包括開源技術專家從他們自己的使用者中聽到的抱怨，比如：「這個過程令人困惑，我不知道是否可以信任開發這個工具的人，以及在那裡在平台上顯示為我的『朋友』的人」，以及一些持續存在的挑戰，例如在設備可能被「扣押」（被警察、政府機構強制沒收以搜尋任何非法或敏感資訊）。在這情況下。這些回應為設計和開發網路自由技術的挑戰增添了更多細節和背景要素，使參與者能夠時刻牢記這些需求。

_“Our persona already knows how to encrypt sensitive data within images (Steganography). This creates a hidden layer of information, safeguarding it from unauthorized access. She then transfers the encrypted files onto USB drives, ensuring physical possession and reducing digital tracking. The real challenge then, if getting it to the right people”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Harmful or adversarial personas (personas non-grata) / 有害或對立的角色（不受歡迎的角色）

We finish off the user research and user feedback evidence section by introducing the concept of an 'Adversarial Persona' or a 'Persona non-grata'. A list of the kinds of people, users and entities that can harm our good-faith and legitimate persona users are offered up, which includes persona types like 'Prankster' (someone who wants to play jokes on other users, divert their attention, distract or disturb their legitimate use) and 'Abuser' (either a romantic partner or other kind of abuser). These Adversarial Persona are useful to consider to explore the complex needs of users. It allows designers and technologists to understand what can harm their users completing key actions and what personal or institutional harm can happen to users on their own platforms. These harmful circumstances can then be accounted for and designed better so that less or none of the Adversarial Persona behaviour can affect users.

我們通過引入「對立角色」或「不受歡迎的角色」的概念來回應以結束使用者研究和使用者回饋部分。我們提供了一份可能傷害我們的善意和合法使用者、使用者和實體類型清單，其中包括諸如「惡作劇者」（想要開玩笑、轉移其他使用者注意力、干擾或打擾他們合法使用的人）和「施虐者」（可能是戀愛關係中的伴侶或其他類型的施虐者）等角色類型。這些對立角色有助於探討使用者的複雜需求。它使設計師和技術專家能夠理解什麼可能會妨礙他們的使用者完成關鍵行動，以及使用者在他們的平台上可能遭受什麼樣的個人或機構傷害。這樣，就可以考慮到這些潛在的有害情況，並進行更好的設計，以減少或消除對立角色行為對使用者的負面影響。

_“Taiwan's status as a high-tech hub contributes to its safety. However, while Taiwan's semiconductor industry is certainly advantageous for security, the 'silicon shield' against China is only one component of the strategy. It alone is insufficient to ensure national security.”_ **- Taro from Team Hotpot**

---

## User scenarios / 使用者情境

User scenarios are an opportunity to use various personas, user feedback and design challenges that begins to tell a story of this persona's daily life, their interaction with technology and OSS tools for internet freedom purposes. These scenario statements begin to tie together details of user personas' lives and technology in a way that can lead to further exploration, isolation of a specific problem, and beginning to explore when and how technology is most and least useful.
The workshop participants are encouraged to remix and adapt these scenarios with the personas they previously chose and developed in their groups. These scenarios act as 'prompts' and ideas for the teams to consider as they build out the user and situation they want to prototype for towards the end of the workshop.

使用者情境為我們提供了一個機會來運用各式角色、用戶反饋和設計挑戰，開始描繪這些角色的日常生活、他們與科技的互動，以及如何使用開源軟體工具來實現網路自由。這些情境描述開始將用戶角色的生活細節和技術巧妙地結合在一起，以便進一步探索、分開特定問題，並開始探討技術何時最有用和最用不到。
我們鼓勵工作坊參與者根據他們先前在小組中選擇和發展的角色，來重新組合和調整這些情境。這些情境不僅僅是簡單的"提示"，更可供團隊在設計原型時充分考慮目標用戶和他們所處的實際情況。

## Simulating a shutdown / 模擬網路中斷

*How well can we really design and develop technology if we haven't experienced what our users have experienced?*

If possible, designers and developers of any technology can find out what it's like to 'be the user'. Most people need to use the essential services and functions online that construct and run our interconnected global lives. However, there are many user experiences and scenarios that we as designers and developers may not have experienced. These are the unique 'stress cases' of users and people that do high-risk human rights and internet freedom work. We can learn more about those experiences by reading about those experiences, speaking with people with those experiences and exploring the thoughts, needs, threats and feelings of users through the exercises and activities like personas, scenarios and journeys. But, if you are able to simulate those experiences to better understand them in a safe and controlled environment then you can begin to experience the micro-decisions that people living under censorship and internet shutdowns experience too.
During this workshop, we interrupted the workshop participants to let them know that until they leave the venue that the internet has been 'shut down' and is inaccessible. Only workshop participants that need to be connected for care responsibility (like caring for the sick, elderly or children) or emergency reasons were 'allowed' to use the internet.
We asked the workshop participants to join us in experiencing what it's like when the internet is shut-down or censored. In reality, the wifi and mobile internet had not been shut-down, but we asked each of the workshop participants to place their devices into airplane mode or to turn off the wifi and mobile internet capabilities for the remaining time of the workshop.
With simulation exercises, simple or complex, you can build a more detailed understanding of how users navigate those circumstances.

*如果我們沒有體驗過成為用戶的經驗，我們真的能很好地設計和開發技術嗎?*

如果可能的話，任何技術設計師和開發人員能夠親身體驗「成為用戶」的感受時。大多數人使用日常構建我們互聯生活的基本線上服務和功能。然而，但設計師和開發人員往往未曾經歷過那些在高風險人權和網路自由領域工作的人所面對的獨特「壓力案例」。透過了解這些經歷、與當事人對話，並利用角色扮演、情境模擬和用戶旅程分析等方式，以及活動來探索用戶的想法、需求、威脅和感受，從而了解更多關於這些經歷的資訊。但是，如果你能夠在安全和被監控的環境中模擬這些經歷以更加地能夠感受，從而開始體驗生活在審查制度和網路中斷下的人們所經歷的微觀決策。
在這次工作坊中，我們告知參與者在活動結束前，「網路已被中斷」，無法連接。只有因照顧責任（如照顧病人、老人或兒童）或緊急原因需要連線的參與者才「允許」使用網路。
我們邀請參與者共同體驗在網路被中斷或審查時的感受。實際上，Wi-Fi 和手機熱點並未被關閉，但我們請每位參與者在剩餘的工作坊時間內，將他們的設備設定為飛行模式，或關閉 Wi-Fi 和手機熱點功能。
通過簡單或複雜的模擬練習，你可以更詳細地了解用戶如何在這些情況下導航。

Imagine the government has imposed a shutdown and there's no internet connection in the room. 2. Switch off the internet on your phones. Maybe even laptops. 3. This might be just a lightweight experience of an actual shutdown. 4. Try to live the scenario in the shoes of the persona you have chosen. You can let your personal experience right now guide what your persona might be going through. 5. We will run the simulation for the duration of the rest of the workshop._

## User journeys / 用戶旅程

The user journey mapping exercise is the last of the 'exploring users' exercises in this workshop plan. It typically includes conversations about the different kinds of actions and choices that can be made during a certain event, time period or meaningful interaction. For example, some groups mapped a person who had essential gathering information during a large city wide protest and some groups mapped a journalist looking to publish a story against their media outlets views. These journeys offer us a further expanded view of our user personas, finding out what they are doing when, where and how they are achieving their actions. Furthermore, how the persona is feeling and thinking during that moment can allow us better insight into how a technology experience should be designed. e.g. if a user is anxious, what can the technology do to help manage that anxiety? If a user is feeling rushed and reckless, how can technology help them make careful and well-researched decisions with their identity and information? These are the kinds of explorations that user journey mapping allows for.

During the workshop, we encouraged participants to think about the different possibilities, and to pick the route their chosen persona would most likely and logically take when faced with a user choice. There are not necessarily any incorrect routes. All routes of a user journey map are worth mapping, so that we can discover as many uses of tools as possible. It's worth understanding when facilitating a user journey mapping exercise that there are what seems to be endless possible choices users can make, both positive and negative. Ideally teams would have time to map out routes until they feel comfortable enough to progress with finding 'key moments' but it is also ok for user journey maps to have unfinished routes, decisions and questions about user behaviors. These can feed into later user research validation for technologies too.

用戶旅程反思練習是本工作坊計劃中「探索用戶」活動的最後一環。這一練習通常涉及討論在某特定事件、時間軸或有意義的互動中，用戶可能採取的各種行動和選擇。例如，一些小組反思了在大規模城市抗議中收集重要信息的經歷，而另一些小組則探討了記者如何報導與主流媒體觀點相左的故事。這些旅程為我們提供了更深入的用戶角色視角，幫助我們了解他們在何時、何地以及如何完成他們的行動。同時，分析用戶在這些時候的情感和思考，可以讓我們更好地設計出符合他們需求的科技體驗。例如，如果用戶感到焦慮，科技應該如何幫助他們緩解壓力？如果用戶在行動中感到匆忙或衝動，科技又該如何幫助他們在管理身份和訊息時做出更謹慎、深思熟慮的決策？這些就是用戶旅程映射所能探索的價值所在。
在我們的工作坊中，我們鼓勵參與者深入思考多種可能性，並選擇最符合所選角色邏輯的行動路線。這裡的關鍵理念是：沒有所謂的"錯誤"路線。每條路徑都具有其獨特的價值，因為它們不僅展現了工具的多樣化用途，還反映了用戶行為的複雜性。
用戶旅程映射的精華在於認識到用戶選擇的多樣性和難以預測的本質。可能出現的正面和負面結果。理想情況下，團隊應有充足時間探索各種可能的路線，直到他們能夠自如地到達到「關鍵時刻」。然而，我們也要理解，未完成的路線、尚未決定的結果，以及對用戶行為的種種疑問，都是正常且可以接受的。

## Discovery moments in user journeys / 用戶旅程中的關鍵發現時刻

After finishing user journey maps participants can be feeling overwhelmed by information and options of the specific parts of a users experience to focus on. At this stage it's important to give teams a way to focus their attention on key moments depending on the purpose and objectives of your workshop. In this workshop, we wanted to attempt to isolate the key moments in the user journeys where technology is used or relied upon for an essential purpose where it may fall short of the expectation of the user. That single moment can then be focused on for the ideation and prototyping phase in order to not spread a team's attention too thinly and explore too many options. We're looking for a small, actionable moment where designing a change could have a big effect.
In our example, we show a user journey map created around a protest in a European country. The internet starts to slow down and communication methods that previously were accessible and safe are no longer so. When looking for key moments here we discovered that people would try to message friends and family and other key contacts when the internet connection begins to fail - when messages don't send and fail the behaviour that users often do is scrolling up in a chat history - we then had an idea that we could send critical info about shutdowns and protest information before the internet goes down to then be 'found' in the history via n eye catching design/text a sort of 'You won't need this info now but you will when the internet goes out, 'proactive' moment for groups sharing information.

當完成用戶旅程後，參與者往往會因為大量的資訊和用戶體驗的複雜性而感到無所適從。這時，引導團隊聚焦於工作坊的具體目標關鍵點變得尤為重要。
在我們的工作坊中，用戶旅程中那些技術應用或使用特定目的是相當重要的，尤其是無法滿足用戶期望的環節。這種方法允許我們將注意力集中在單一但至關重要的點上，為後續的構思和打造模型階段奠定基礎。我們在尋找一個小而可行的點，在那裡通過設計改變，能夠產生顯著影響。
在我們的例子中，我們展示了一個針對歐洲國家抗議活動所設計的用戶旅程圖。當網路開始變慢，以前可用且安全的通訊方法變得不再可靠。在尋找關鍵時刻時，我們發現當網路連線開始失效時，人們會試圖給朋友、家人和其他重要聯絡人發送訊息，而當訊息無法送達時，用戶經常會在聊天記錄中向上滾動。基於這一行為，我們產生了一個想法：在網路中斷之前，預先發送關於中斷和抗議的關鍵訊息，並在聊天歷史記錄中以醒目的設計或文本進行標註，這樣當網路中斷時，用戶可以在需要時輕鬆找到這些訊息。這是一個主動的時刻，提前為用戶和訊息分享提供他們在關鍵點所需的支持。

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Ideate and design / 構思與設計

The last activity in this workshop on design processes is ideation. After teams have identified as many key moments in their user journey and are well-informed and ready to start generating ideas, they can start with idea generation. We ask that the groups discuss the key moments and ensure they are all happy with the moment picked and then discuss the potential ideas that solve for a specific key moment for a user. These ideas can include UI, new OSS tools and technologies, and leverage existing ones. The teams are encouraged to explore more 'blue sky' thinking and less about the detailed technical feasibility and implementation. The main objective here is to explore the solutions while continually referring back to the user journeys, user scenarios and user personas to ensure that the solutions meet the needs of the users.
Participants should however, be advised to stay within the realms of technological possibility and not go into science fiction technology. The tool landscape and demos serve the purpose for grounding the reality of the technological space. During ideation teams should have a 'storyboard' layout for their idea that they think, when looking back at the user insight, solves their problems. These storyboards often communicate both the human action and the technology/device action in them. The critical element that this workshop has brought is the lived experiences of the citizens participating in the workshop.

在這次以設計流程為主題的工作坊中，最後一項活動是構思。在團隊辨識了用戶旅程中的關鍵點，並對其有充分了解後，他們就可以開始進行想法的生成。我們鼓勵小組討論這些關鍵點，並確保對所選的重點達成共識，再針對用戶的特定關鍵點探索潛在解決方案。這些想法可以包括用戶介面、新的開源工具和技術，或是對現有技術的靈活運用。團隊被鼓勵採用更多「自由發想」，不必過於拘泥於技術細節或實施的可行性。這項活動的核心目標是，不斷參照用戶旅程、情境和用戶角色的同時，探索能夠滿足用戶需求的解決方案。
然而，參與者應被提醒要保持在技術可行性的範疇內，不要超出現實進入科幻技術的領域。工具範疇和展示的目的是將思考範圍落實在現有的技術空間中。在構思階段，團隊應為他們的想法設計「分鏡腳本」，從用戶洞察的角度出發，解決他們面臨的問題。這些分鏡腳本通常同時表達了人類行為和技術／設備行為之間的互動。這次工作坊的一個關鍵要素是參與者所帶來的真實生活經驗。

## Documentation / 文件紀錄

Finally, at the end of the workshop after everyone has had a chance to talk about their proposed solutions to their user journey key moments, we encourage the participants to document the ideas and conversations on a platform of their choice. If the host event has documentation platforms they'd like you to use or if the participants have their own platforms they'd like to use then those platforms should take priority. Documentation is communicated as an important exercise to designers and human rights activists that are not familiar with OSS practices. Documentation that is privacy respecting while being as open as possible is how this work and these ideas live on past the workshop day.
The outcomes of these kinds of workshops are far-reaching for OSS for internet freedom and human rights. There's plenty that can be learned from participants who have their own lived experience and relationships to the subject matter.

最後，在工作坊結束時，在每個人都有機會分享他們針對用戶旅程關鍵點提出的解決方案後，我們鼓勵參與者在他們選擇的平台上記錄這些想法和對話。如果主辦活動有指定的文件記錄平台，或是參與者有偏好的平台，則應優先使用這些平台。文件紀錄對於不熟悉開源軟體的設計師和人權活動人士來說，是一個非常重要的過程。文件紀錄應該在尊重隱私的前提下，公開分享工作坊成果，以確保這些工作和想法在工作坊結束後能夠持續發揮影響力。

這類工作坊的成果對於推動開源軟體在網路自由及人權領域的發展具有深遠影響。我們能與從參與者的真實經歷及其與相關議題的連結中獲得寶貴的見解。

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: Wrap up﻿ and Documentation An important part of this workshop was engaging with the topic 'What if the internet was not available in a critical moment for these users?' and explore their journeys . Your work and insight can now be used to improve tools during internet shutdowns and crises. We'd like each group to speak about their persona, journey map and ideas they came up with - We'll be documenting them in the HackMD notes and you can also add details. We'll move these ideas to Github anonymously._

## Running a workshop for designers and technologists on OSS Internet Freedom technology

If you find yourself inspired to run a workshop for designers, OSS maintainers, technologists and Internet Freedom activists after reading this we have resources available in an Open Github repository: https://github.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/tree/main. You can also find an open virtual whiteboard https://bit.ly/DesignatCOSCUP  (We use Miro.com for our workshop plans and resources). We make sure to build workshop content that is inclusive of people new to design processes in open source. The intersection of design, open source software and internet freedom technology is small but growing and we make content that is accessible and helps grow understanding of each other.

We encourage you to use whatever resources and structures work for you and your communities. If you’d like support or advice on how to plan and run a workshop then you can contact us on the following email hi@superbloom.design. Superbloom staff have planned and facilitated design and OSS contribution workshops internationally and are particularly interested in how we bring more designers and design practices into the open source software community and the internet freedom and human rights technology space.

# Why Design and designers are important for Internet Freedom OSS / 為什麼設計和設計師對於網路自由 OSS 很重要

The enthusiasm that technologists express when speaking about human rights, civic tech and privacy and security tools is admirable. They create and configure these tools, advocate for their use and their continual improvement with a passion that is frequently connected to a very real and intense life experience. Yet when you speak to the users of these tools, ordinary people, not especially technologically experienced, though experienced enough to know that they need these tools in order to stay safe, private and independent you hear the similar passion for human rights sprinkled with moderate to large amounts of frustration. 

- *“Why can’t the privacy settings be more clear and understandable?”*

- *“It’s so difficult to communicate to the people we train in digital privacy that to be safe, they have to switch VPN sometimes. It’s hard to communicate why”*

- *“Well I use these tools for my journalism reporting but, honestly I still use big techs communication tools too, even though I know it’s risky they are easier to use and my family won’t switch to secure tools.”*

Technologists notice these issues from their users as critical usability bugs in their technologies. Here is where designers and their design practices can mitigate problems for users and equalize the access and use of critical human rights and civic technologies. Designers seek to prioritize both expert and novice use of technology.

Designers and their practices bridge the experiences between tool developers and citizen users. It should never be a requirement to fully comprehend the technologies inner workings in order to use it to be safe. Here is the bridge designers and technologists in partnership build to bring users across, towards safe and secure existence and interaction with tech. Designers humanize the needs and purposes of technology in order to make it useful across a spectrum of global daily life experiences. Designers want to, by their very practice, include and make accessible. Designers, when given the opportunity to use design practice to do good, will do good.

Yet the barriers for designers and design practice to be normalized in Internet Freedom OSS technology are great. Design practice often registers as less vital than technological skills. Less budgeted for, less respected, less served by online collaboration platforms yet in design practice is where the interaction between the lived experience of the human meets technology and is humanized. Humanising technology and understanding these high risk, complex human rights defenders experiences is where we find the focus of the design events and hackathons like those hosted at COSCUP.

技術人員在人權、公民科技和隱私安全工具領域的熱忱令人欽佩他們開發並讓這些工具可更加完善，源自於真切而深刻的生活體驗。然而，一般用戶雖然認知到這些工具的必要性，卻常常感到無力：然而，當你與這些工具的普通用戶交談時，你會發現他們對人權同樣熱忱，卻又夾雜著不同程度的無力感。這些用戶雖不精通科技技術，但深知這些工具對保障自身安全、隱私和獨立的重要性。

- 「為何隱私設置不能更直觀？」
- 「向學員解釋為何安全需要時常切換VPN，這很困難」
- 「雖然我在寫稿中使用較具安全性的工具，但日常還是會用一般大品牌的通訊軟體，因為它們更方便，家人也不願改用安全工具。」

這些問題被技術人員視為嚴重的易用性bug。而設計師的專業正能彌補這一問題，讓重要的人權和公民科技工具更易於使用和普及。設計師致力於兼顧專業技術用戶和新手的需求。
設計師搭建了開發者和用戶間的橋樑。擁有較高的安全性不應以完全理解內部運作的技術為前提。設計師和技術專家合作，引導用戶在具安全隱私保護性下地與科技互動。他們將技術需求人性化，使之適應全世界各種日常場景。設計師的核心理念是包容性和普遍性，他們渴望通過設計實踐造福社會。
然而，設計在網路自由開源軟體領域的重要性仍未得到充分認可。與技術技能相比，設計實踐常被視為次要，獲得的資源和重視度較低。但正是在設計中，人類經驗與技術相融，實現了人性化。理解高風險、複雜的人權捍衛者的需求，正是COSCUP等設計活動和黑客松的核心。

# Why COSCUP is an important event for Internet Freedom OSS / 為什麼 COSCUP 是網路自由 OSS 的重要活動

COSCUP is one of the biggest and important international open source events in Taiwan. It receives a high number of participants interested not only in tech but also design which makes it a great spot for discourse from critical perspectives of people involved in building solutions for internet freedom i.e. technologists and designers. COSCUP is also very welcoming and offers flexibility in tailoring workshops and discussions around open source and internet freedom topics. 

COSCUP, being held in Taiwan, also offers a neutral or rather a more positive space (geographically) with a freedom of speech and freedom of press to talk and spread ideas concerning sensitive topics such as the human rights especially those of the marginalized communities who are most in need of internet freedom tools and technologies to protect their privacy and security digitally. There are also other organizations and individuals in Taiwan working on complex issues of human rights  and building civic technologies. If anything, there needs to be a greater involvement among such persons. Most countries surrounding Taiwan may not offer the same level of freedom. This makes COSCUP an important event for internet freedom OSS in South East Asia and broader parts of Asia. 

The need for privacy, security and finding ways to stay connected as a community in the face of internet instability is also very real for the Taiwanese. They recognize their relationship with CCP, they understand the natural calamity can impact their infrastructure and hence believe in staying prepared. From our experience of running workshops in COSCUP, these have been key problem areas that the participants chose to design their solutions for. 

COSCUP 是台灣最大且最重要的國際開源活動之一，吸引了大量不僅對技術感興趣，還對設計感興趣的參與者。這樣的參與者組成使 COSCUP 匯聚了技術人員、設計師等，提供了一個絕佳的平台。讓他們能從不同的角度進行深入討論。此外，COSCUP 也非常友善且有彈性， 以「開源」與「網路自由」為核心，來設計工作坊與研討會議程。

COSCUP 在台灣舉辦，提供了一個更中立或更積極的空間（地理位置上），在這裡享有言論自由和新聞自由，可以討論和傳播有關敏感議題的想法，如人權問題，尤其是那些最需要網路自由工具和技術來保護其數位隱私和安全的弱勢群體。台灣還有其他組織和個人在致力於解決複雜的人權問題和開發公民科技。事實上，這些人之間需要有更高度的參與與機會合作。先對於周邊國家，台灣提供了相對開放的環境，使 COSCUP 成為東南亞及更廣泛亞洲地區網路自由與開源軟體領域的指標性會議。

對於台灣人來說，深切感受到網路不穩定的影響，同時對個人隱私與安全存有高度的關注。他們清楚認知與中國共產黨的關係，並理解自然災害可能會影響其基礎設施，因此注重做好準備。根據我們在 COSCUP 舉辦工作坊的經驗，這些問題一直是許多參與者選擇設計解決方案的核心重點。

**“Speculating on a ‘war situation’ we Taiwanese think that Taiwan would go through circumstances similar to the Russo-Ukrainian War with actual military intervention...China has already employed cognitive warfare strategy, through disinformation, military intimidation, and influence operations for many years.” - Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

# # Taiwan's relationship to internet freedom and OSS / 台灣的網路自由與開源軟體現狀

*What are the threats to internet freedom in Taiwan and what do regular people and technologists think about internet freedom?*

Taiwan is widely recognized for its high level of internet freedom, ranking sixth globally and first in Asia according to Freedom House's 2023 report. With an internet penetration rate of 90.7% as of January 2024, Taiwanese citizens view internet access as a fundamental right. This freedom has fostered a vibrant civic tech community that collaborates with the government to promote transparency and openness.

However, Taiwan faces unique challenges to its internet freedom. The country is on the frontline of China's "Cognitive Warfare," which includes disinformation campaigns, military intimidation, and influence operations. These threats have put pressure on Taiwan's online information ecosystem, potentially manipulating public opinion and threatening the integrity of its digital spaces.
The open source software (OSS) community in Taiwan has responded to these challenges by developing locally-focused projects. Many of these initiatives, like the fact-checking bot Cofacts, are designed to address Taiwan-specific issues and are deeply integrated into popular local platforms. While this approach effectively serves the Taiwanese context, it can make these tools difficult to replicate in other countries.

台灣的網路自由度享譽全球，在自由之家2023年報告中位列全球第六、亞洲第一。截至2024年1月，台灣網路普及率高達90.7%，全民視網路使用權為基本權利。這樣的自由環境孕育了蓬勃的公民科技社群，與政府攜手推動政策透明度和開源開放。

然而，台灣面臨獨特的挑戰。作為抵禦中國「認知戰」的最前線，台灣須應對包括假訊息傳播、軍事威脅和影響力操作等威脅。這些因素不僅衝擊台灣的網路，還可能影響公眾輿論，危及數位空間的完整性。
為應對這些挑戰，台灣開源（OSS）社群積極開發本土專案。如事實查核機器人Cofacts等項目，專門針對台灣特有問題設計，並與本地主流平台深度整合。這種方法雖然在台灣環境中有亮眼的成效，但可能難移植到其他國家。

# What is the purpose of this Document?

As it would be apparent from the above sections, Superbloom conducted a workshop at COSCUP in 2023 on the topic of ‘Designing for Human Rights and Internet Freedom OSS’. This workshop brought together different kinds of contributors (developers, engineers, designers and OSS enthusiasts etc.) to utilize design practices, methods and research to explore the topic of internet shutdowns and censorship in Taiwan and how OSS technology can be used and improved from their perspectives. During the workshop, the participants developed various artifacts such as -  improved personas, detailed user journey maps, discovering problems and finding solutions to prepare for internet shutdown scenarios. 

The purpose of this report/output is to preserve and present all the artifacts in a structured, translated(in Chinese) and detailed manner along with design experts’ contexts. These outputs are also published on a public GitHub repository so that there’s a continuity with future workshops as opposed to being lost and forgotten. This output includes commentary on how to run similar workshops thereby enabling other design facilitators to learn and recreate them. We hope others will iterate on these resources, reference them in future workshops and build on this work.

In summary, we hope that this will:
- Enhance accessibility and understandability of the workshop artifacts
- Increase knowledge sharing and collaboration on this topic
- Empower other design practitioners
- Increase community engagement and participation
- Lead to productive solutions that benefits people in need

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Introduction and framing the workshop / 工作坊的介紹與框架

When beginning the workshop, there must be a welcoming and inviting feeling. Many designers have not experienced the Free and Open Source (FOSS or OSS) space or gained much experience with the Internet Freedom, Human rights technology or censorship circumvention technology space. The OSS and Human Rights technology space share many commonalities and the development and coding practices are familiar to each other, but design in both these spaces are rare. Ensure that workshop participants are welcome to bring their own thoughts, critique and experience as well as asking detailed and basic questions is welcome.
This workshop can be attended by designers, coders, developers, technologists and those interested in OSS or involved in OSS. It's also good for journalists, human rights defenders, civic technologists or people who work at NGOs or charities that are committed to a non-political/non-partisan, human rights inclusive approach. People involved in 'Big Tech', surveillance technology or who are politically aligned can also join these workshops, especially if they are openly accessible and available, but the framing of the workshop should be clearly communicated that we are prioritizing privacy, security and digital human rights globally with this work.


工作坊應以營造友善和歡迎的氛圍為首要任務。許多設計師可能對自由開源軟體（FOSS 或 OSS）、網路自由、人權科技或反審查技術等領域尚感陌生。雖然 OSS 和人權科技領域在開發和寫code實踐上有諸多相似之處，但這兩個領域內的設計層面的工作仍屬少見。因此，我們需要確保參與者能夠自在地分享想法、提出建議和分享經驗，同時鼓勵他們提出各種問題，無論是細微的還是基本的。
這個工作坊歡迎多元背景的參與者，包括：
1. 設計師、寫code的人、開發者和技術專家
2. 對 OSS 感興趣或已參與 OSS 的人士
3. 記者、人權捍衛者和公民科技工作者
4. 在非政治性/非黨派性、注重人權的非政府組織或慈善機構工作的人員
我們也歡迎來自科技公司、監控技術領域的從業者或具有政治傾向的人士參加，尤其是在工作坊以公開且自由參與的前提下。然而，我們會明確傳達工作坊的核心宗旨：優先考慮全球的隱私、安全和數位人權。

## Facilitators / 引導者

For this workshop, it is important to have some different sectors and expertise present. We recommend local design groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.), OSS designers and/or coders, developers or maintainers of those OSS projects and designers who are experts in the internet freedom, human rights and censorship circumvention technology space. Facilitation should ideally be shared between these groups and done by those who feel most comfortable and able to facilitate in an engaging and clear way towards the designers and technologists participating in the workshop.

工作坊的成功關鍵在於融合多元領域的專業知識。我們建議邀請以下專家：
1. 當地設計社群代表（如 IxDA、Ideo、Ladies that UX 等）
2. OSS 設計師和/或寫code的人
3. OSS 項目的開發者或維護者
4. 網路自由、人權和反審查技術領域的專業設計師
工作坊引導應由這些群體共同分擔，優先選擇能夠以吸引人和清晰方式帶領參與者的人。

_“In the team, most people identified as engineers, one person had some design training but was not currently in a design job role. However, they ended up playing a key facilitation role between the engineer discussions and keeping the focus on the users.”_ **- Sugar from Team Cake**

## Open source design experts / 開源設計專家

People who work on or have contributed to OSS generally are valuable participants of this workshop. They are able to give insight and context on OSS culture, communication and expectations across a broad selection of OSS projects. They can also typically operate and use the interfaces and processes needed to contribute to OSS more quickly and effectively than those completely new to these but also can support and teach other participants at the workshop how to use OSS processes and functions e.g. how to submit an issue, how to create a branch, how to install, run and use an OSS project/tool.

OSS 領域的從業者或貢獻者是工作坊的寶貴資產。他們可以：
- 提供 OSS 項目的深入洞見和背景知識
- 分享 OSS 文化、溝通方式和社群期望
- 熟練操作 OSS 貢獻流程和工具
- 指導新手使用 OSS 流程，如提交問題、創建分支、安裝和使用 OSS 項目等

_“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

## Internet freedom tool experts / 網路自由工具專家

These can be designers, technologists or people who have worked/volunteered in the NGO, Internet Freedom, Journalism or Civic Technology space. They offer insight into the complex and nuanced challenges faced by those institutions and individuals doing human rights advocacy and work. The areas of knowledge are broad and it's best to look for people with knowledge in a specific type of human rights depending on the focus of the workshop. For example, our workshop in 2023 focussed on experiences of journalists, researchers and protestors who are at risk of being surveilled as well as targeted with online harassment and violence when they have critical information or attendance at events that may target them as human rights defenders. Along with these types of people we also focussed on when the internet is shut down or when certain information (or access to information) is censored.

這類專家可能來自非政府組織、網路自由、新聞業或公民科技領域，包括設計師、技術專家或其他相關人員。他們的價值在於：
- 深入理解人權倡導工作中的複雜挑戰
- 提供特定人權領域的專業知識
- 分享實際案例和經驗
例如，2023 年的工作坊聚焦於：
1. 記者、研究人員和社運者面臨的風險，如監視、網路騷擾和暴力
2. 網路中斷關閉和訊息審查的應對策略
這樣的專家組合能確保工作坊涵蓋理論和實踐，為參與者提供全面的學習體驗。

_“I appreciated the civic and social focus of the workshop, which contrasts my day job where design must always be monetized for commercial purposes. The most educational part came from the feedback provided by the designers working in Internet Freedom and those with experiences of these complex  Human Rights issues. I found it valuable to directly see how different teams approached the same topic with unique processes and solutions.”_ **- Mint from Team Mojito**

---

## Local design community experts / 本地設計社群專家

Local design expert community groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.) should be present at the workshop to act as experts in design processes and practices but also how these processes and practices are done in the country's local context. We should not assume that design processes are the same all around the globe.

建議應邀請當地設計社群（如 IxDA、Ideo、Ladies that UX 等）的專家參與工作坊，這些專家不僅熟悉設計流程和實踐，還了解這些流程在本地文化背景中的應用。我們不應假設設計流程在全世界都是一致的。

## Clear planning and agenda in OSS contribution / OSS 貢獻的明確規劃和議程

It's important to enable many forms of engagement in a workshop where you are aiming to investigate open source technology and make contributions. Some participants may want to work on their own machines for privacy and security reasons and also may not be comfortable connecting to insecure internet services. We also made sure that participation via writing and using sticky notes, pens and paper was prioritized. 

These methods often allow for better collaboration, communication and also spreads the risk of who added what detail and when, across a larger group of people. Paper, when digitized carefully can be more anonymous and also can be destroyed more completely than digital files that often leave a traceable trail when interacted with.

We also ensure that setting an agenda with objectives is clear from the beginning. Ensuring that there is the ability to be flexible within these times should participants want less or more time on certain activities and processes. There doesn't need to be very strict times for each activity but allowing for a minimum and a maximum time can help with planning the overall objectives of the workshop.

**The overall objective for this iteration of the workshop were:**
- Map and understand user behaviour during internet shutdowns and crisis
- Understand and explore the OSS tools ecosystem in a Taiwan context
- Ideate how OSS tools can 'fight' internet shutdowns can be designed better for Taiwanese citizens

We advise building in time to have participants that are interested in speaking out loud to the group about progress on ideas and activities that are included in an agenda plan. Sharing ideas out loud when working in smaller groups for a larger event can allow for people to be inspired by others' findings, ideas and processes which can enrich the ideas overall.

主旨在研究和貢獻開源技術的工作坊中，為參與者提供多元的參與方式相當重要。一些參與者可能基於隱私和安全考慮，更希望在自己的裝備上操作，並避免連接到不安全的網路連線。因此，我們將優先考慮非數位化的參與方式，如書寫、便利貼、筆和紙。這些方法不僅能促進更好的協作與溝通，還能在保護隱私的同時分散風險，避免數位足跡的留下。當需要數位化時，我們將謹慎處理紙本資料，以確保其匿名性。

我們將從一開始就明確設置議程和目標，並在時間安排上保持彈性，以便參與者就需要調整各項活動的時間。雖然每項活動不必嚴格限制時間，但設置最短和最長的時限有助於達成工作坊的整體目標。

本次工作坊的主要目標為：
- 繪製並理解用戶在網路中斷和危機期間的行為模式。
- 探索和理解在台灣背景下的 OSS 工具生態系統。
- 設計出適合台灣公民應對網路中斷的 OSS 工具。

我們建議在議程中安排分享環節，讓有興趣的參與者向大家報告進展和想法。這能促進跨組的經驗交流，讓所有人從其他人的結論和觀點中汲取靈感。

## Openness and safety / 開放性與安全性

Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter of this workshop, we make sure to announce that Internet Shutdowns and Human Rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject and that we want participants to be safe. This means that we request participants to be careful with what they say, if they feel like it could put them at risk if shared outside this workshop. Additionally the organizers of the workshop or the participants may want to create their own threat/risk models and threat/risk analysis. This can be a simple written or verbal document that if a topic is discussed they may need to remove themselves from that subject or the entire workshop at that point or that they make sure to use an alias unconnected to their legal identity throughout the workshop. They can also opt out of topics and discussions and let others in the group know (with consent) what the impact could be to them if a certain topic was discussed.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20openness%20and%20safety.jpg)

_Image caption: A screengrab of the slide used in the workshop for openness and safety. The text reads: “Guiding principles and openness of results and anonymisation. Internet Shutdowns and human rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject. We want you to be as safe as possible so we encourage being careful with speaking about what we explore today. Some of these OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that national governments would prefer citizens not to access and share._

Some of the OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that certain institutions, organizations and governments would prefer citizens not to access and share. This is a critical topic to discuss in these kinds of workshops but OSS tools should only be accessed, tested and used on participants' own device if they feel comfortable and not pressured to do so by the group. Alternatively, we recommend bringing test devices with OSS tools pre-loaded on these devices to be used if possible.
We recommend participants to not share insecure contact details with each other, to be careful with disclosing any political opinions or personal details about themselves unless they are very sure that they are safe and can trust the one they're sharing with.
In the absence of experts in any area, participants who feel they have enough insight into those topics can act as experts or those questions and topics can be deferred until post workshop when answers or details can be gathered.

鑑於此次工作坊涉及網路中斷和人權科技這類敏感話題，我們重視參與者的安全。我們將提醒參與者在發言時謹慎考慮，避免透露可能在工作坊外危及自身的資訊。工作坊的組織者和參與者也可以建立自己的避險套路，以便在討論到敏感話題時做出適當的應對，例如退出討論或使用與合法身份無關的別名。
一些 OSS 工具被積極用於促進公民獲取和分享某些敏感資訊，因此，在工作坊中討論這些工具時，應尊重每位參與者的舒適度。如果可能，建議攜帶預裝 OSS 工具的測試設備，以便在需要時進行使用。
為了保障安全，建議參與者避免互相分享不安全的聯繫方式，並在不確定對方可信任度的情況下謹慎透露政治觀點或個人詳細資訊。如果在某些領域缺乏專家，可以邀請熟悉相關主題的參與者暫時擔任專家角色，或者將這些問題留待工作坊後進一步探討。

## Forming groups / 分組

There are many methods that can be used to help people form groups. We recommend that groups be no less than 3 people and no more than 6 when collaborating in a workshop environment on OSS and Internet freedom projects. It's good to encourage participants to spread out the various functions they can perform and insights they can give.
For example, you want to encourage a group to have a 2 / 2 / 2 ratio - 2 designers, 2 OSS technologists/developers and 2 Internet Freedom/NGO insights people. Some people can perform more than one of these roles (e.g. A designer might also work in an NGO or an OSS developer might also have experiences of protests) which is fine. As long as your groups have diverse experience, skills and insights and can communicate and collaborate respectfully, you have a good group.
We try to encourage people to meet new people in these workshops which can be effective in mixing up experiences, perspectives and allows for some skill sharing. We used the 'shopping list' method for mixing up teams - everyone in the room thought of an ingredient for their favorite food or drink. (e.g. 'cheese') and then 1 group leader is picked to say out loud the ingredients that makes their food of choice, out loud they will say 'I need pepperoni!' and if another person chose pepperoni they would join that team. The group leader then keeps saying ingredients for their food until they have 5-6 people and as many ingredients as they can to 'make' that food. The team's name then becomes their food type e.g. 'Team Pizza'.

有許多方式可以協助分組，在以開源軟體和網路自由為主題的工作坊中進行專案協作時，我們建議小組人數介於3到6人之間。推薦鼓勵參與者以他們的能發揮工作項目來提供見解。
例如，你可以鼓勵每組維持2/2/2的比例 ： 2名設計師、2名開源專家/開發人員和2名網路自由//非營利組織顧問 。有些人可以擔任多重角色(例如，設計師也可能在非政府組織工作，或者開源軟體開發人員也可能有參與社運的經驗)，這是可以的。關鍵在於小組擁有多樣化的經驗、技能和見解，並且能夠以互相尊重的方式進行溝通與協作，就可以說是一個理想的小組。
我們試圖鼓勵人們在這些工作坊中結識新朋友，這可以有效地促進經驗、觀點的交流，並有機會讓技能共享。我們採用了"購物清單"的分組方式 - 我們讓每個人都想到他們最喜歡的食物或飲料中的一種配料。(例如「起司」)，接著挑選1位小組組長，請他大聲說出構成他們選擇的食物的配料，他們可能會說：「我需要意大利辣香腸!」如果有人選擇了意大利臘腸，他們就會加入那組。小組組長會繼續喊出食物的配料，直到他們有5-6個人，同時盡可能列舉更多配料來「製作」那道美食。最後，團隊以他們的食物命名，例如「披薩隊」。這種方法不僅能打破陌生感，還能在歡樂的氛圍中自然而然地形成多元化的小組。

## Running a workshop for designers and technologists on OSS Internet Freedom technology

If you find yourself inspired to run a workshop for designers, OSS maintainers, technologists and Internet Freedom activists after reading this we have resources available in an Open Github repository: https://github.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/tree/main. You can also find an open virtual whiteboard https://bit.ly/DesignatCOSCUP  (We use Miro.com for our workshop plans and resources). We make sure to build workshop content that is inclusive of people new to design processes in open source. The intersection of design, open source software and internet freedom technology is small but growing and we make content that is accessible and helps grow understanding of each other.

We encourage you to use whatever resources and structures work for you and your communities. If you’d like support or advice on how to plan and run a workshop then you can contact us on the following email hi@superbloom.design. Superbloom staff have planned and facilitated design and OSS contribution workshops internationally and are particularly interested in how we bring more designers and design practices into the open source software community and the internet freedom and human rights technology space.

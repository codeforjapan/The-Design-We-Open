# Why Design and designers are important for Internet Freedom OSS

The enthusiasm that technologists express when speaking about human rights, civic tech and privacy and security tools is admirable. They create and configure these tools, advocate for their use and their continual improvement with a passion that is frequently connected to a very real and intense life experience. Yet when you speak to the users of these tools, ordinary people, not especially technologically experienced, though experienced enough to know that they need these tools in order to stay safe, private and independent you hear the similar passion for human rights sprinkled with moderate to large amounts of frustration. 

- *“Why can’t the privacy settings be more clear and understandable?”*

- *“It’s so difficult to communicate to the people we train in digital privacy that to be safe, they have to switch VPN sometimes. It’s hard to communicate why”*

- *“Well I use these tools for my journalism reporting but, honestly I still use big techs communication tools too, even though I know it’s risky they are easier to use and my family won’t switch to secure tools.”*

Technologists notice these issues from their users as critical usability bugs in their technologies. Here is where designers and their design practices can mitigate problems for users and equalize the access and use of critical human rights and civic technologies. Designers seek to prioritize both expert and novice use of technology.

Designers and their practices bridge the experiences between tool developers and citizen users. It should never be a requirement to fully comprehend the technologies inner workings in order to use it to be safe. Here is the bridge designers and technologists in partnership build to bring users across, towards safe and secure existence and interaction with tech. Designers humanize the needs and purposes of technology in order to make it useful across a spectrum of global daily life experiences. Designers want to, by their very practice, include and make accessible. Designers, when given the opportunity to use design practice to do good, will do good.

Yet the barriers for designers and design practice to be normalized in Internet Freedom OSS technology are great. Design practice often registers as less vital than technological skills. Less budgeted for, less respected, less served by online collaboration platforms yet in design practice is where the interaction between the lived experience of the human meets technology and is humanized. Humanising technology and understanding these high risk, complex human rights defenders experiences is where we find the focus of the design events and hackathons like those hosted at COSCUP.

**“The team found that the workshop format was effective in bridging the gap between technical and non-technical participants, showing the power of design processes in building and improving technology” - Sugar from Team Cake**

# Why COSCUP is an important event for Internet Freedom OSS

COSCUP is one of the biggest and important international open source events in Taiwan. It receives a high number of participants interested not only in tech but also design which makes it a great spot for discourse from critical perspectives of people involved in building solutions for internet freedom i.e. technologists and designers. COSCUP is also very welcoming and offers flexibility in tailoring workshops and discussions around open source and internet freedom topics. 

COSCUP, being held in Taiwan, also offers a neutral or rather a more positive space (geographically) with a freedom of speech and freedom of press to talk and spread ideas concerning sensitive topics such as the human rights especially those of the marginalized communities who are most in need of internet freedom tools and technologies to protect their privacy and security digitally. There are also other organizations and individuals in Taiwan working on complex issues of human rights  and building civic technologies. If anything, there needs to be a greater involvement among such persons. Most countries surrounding Taiwan may not offer the same level of freedom. This makes COSCUP an important event for internet freedom OSS in South East Asia and broader parts of Asia. 

The need for privacy, security and finding ways to stay connected as a community in the face of internet instability is also very real for the Taiwanese. They recognize their relationship with CCP, they understand the natural calamity can impact their infrastructure and hence believe in staying prepared. From our experience of running workshops in COSCUP, these have been key problem areas that the participants chose to design their solutions for. 

_“Speculating on a ‘war situation’ we Taiwanese think that Taiwan would go through circumstances similar to the Russo-Ukrainian War with actual military intervention...China has already employed cognitive warfare strategy, through disinformation, military intimidation, and influence operations for many years.”_ **- Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

# Taiwan's relationship to internet freedom and OSS 

*What are the threats to internet freedom in Taiwan and what do regular people and technologists think about internet freedom?*

Taiwan is widely recognized for its high level of internet freedom, ranking sixth globally and first in Asia according to Freedom House's 2023 report. With an internet penetration rate of 90.7% as of January 2024, Taiwanese citizens view internet access as a fundamental right. This freedom has fostered a vibrant civic tech community that collaborates with the government to promote transparency and openness.

However, Taiwan faces unique challenges to its internet freedom. The country is on the frontline of China's "Cognitive Warfare," which includes disinformation campaigns, military intimidation, and influence operations. These threats have put pressure on Taiwan's online information ecosystem, potentially manipulating public opinion and threatening the integrity of its digital spaces.
The open source software (OSS) community in Taiwan has responded to these challenges by developing locally-focused projects. Many of these initiatives, like the fact-checking bot Cofacts, are designed to address Taiwan-specific issues and are deeply integrated into popular local platforms. While this approach effectively serves the Taiwanese context, it can make these tools difficult to replicate in other countries.

# What is the purpose of this Document?

As it would be apparent from the above sections, Superbloom conducted a workshop at COSCUP in 2023 on the topic of ‘Designing for Human Rights and Internet Freedom OSS’. This workshop brought together different kinds of contributors (developers, engineers, designers and OSS enthusiasts etc.) to utilize design practices, methods and research to explore the topic of internet shutdowns and censorship in Taiwan and how OSS technology can be used and improved from their perspectives. During the workshop, the participants developed various artifacts such as -  improved personas, detailed user journey maps, discovering problems and finding solutions to prepare for internet shutdown scenarios. 

The purpose of this report/output is to preserve and present all the artifacts in a structured, translated(in Chinese) and detailed manner along with design experts’ contexts. These outputs are also published on a public GitHub repository so that there’s a continuity with future workshops as opposed to being lost and forgotten. This output includes commentary on how to run similar workshops thereby enabling other design facilitators to learn and recreate them. We hope others will iterate on these resources, reference them in future workshops and build on this work.

In summary, we hope that this will:
- Enhance accessibility and understandability of the workshop artifacts
- Increase knowledge sharing and collaboration on this topic
- Empower other design practitioners
- Increase community engagement and participation
- Lead to productive solutions that benefits people in need

# Workshop Methods and processes

## Introduction and framing the workshop / 工作坊的介紹與框架

When beginning the workshop, there must be a welcoming and inviting feeling. Many designers have not experienced the Free and Open Source (FOSS or OSS) space or gained much experience with the Internet Freedom, Human rights technology or censorship circumvention technology space. The OSS and Human Rights technology space share many commonalities and the development and coding practices are familiar to each other, but design in both these spaces are rare. Ensure that workshop participants are welcome to bring their own thoughts, critique and experience as well as asking detailed and basic questions is welcome.
This workshop can be attended by designers, coders, developers, technologists and those interested in OSS or involved in OSS. It's also good for journalists, human rights defenders, civic technologists or people who work at NGOs or charities that are committed to a non-political/non-partisan, human rights inclusive approach. People involved in 'Big Tech', surveillance technology or who are politically aligned can also join these workshops, especially if they are openly accessible and available, but the framing of the workshop should be clearly communicated that we are prioritizing privacy, security and digital human rights globally with this work.

## Facilitators

For this workshop, it is important to have some different sectors and expertise present. We recommend local design groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.), OSS designers and/or coders, developers or maintainers of those OSS projects and designers who are experts in the internet freedom, human rights and censorship circumvention technology space. Facilitation should ideally be shared between these groups and done by those who feel most comfortable and able to facilitate in an engaging and clear way towards the designers and technologists participating in the workshop.

_“In the team, most people identified as engineers, one person had some design training but was not currently in a design job role. However, they ended up playing a key facilitation role between the engineer discussions and keeping the focus on the users.”_ **- Sugar from Team Cake**

---

## Open source design experts

People who work on or have contributed to OSS generally are valuable participants of this workshop. They are able to give insight and context on OSS culture, communication and expectations across a broad selection of OSS projects. They can also typically operate and use the interfaces and processes needed to contribute to OSS more quickly and effectively than those completely new to these but also can support and teach other participants at the workshop how to use OSS processes and functions e.g. how to submit an issue, how to create a branch, how to install, run and use an OSS project/tool.

_“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

## Internet freedom tool experts

These can be designers, technologists or people who have worked/volunteered in the NGO, Internet Freedom, Journalism or Civic Technology space. They offer insight into the complex and nuanced challenges faced by those institutions and individuals doing human rights advocacy and work. The areas of knowledge are broad and it's best to look for people with knowledge in a specific type of human rights depending on the focus of the workshop. For example, our workshop in 2023 focussed on experiences of journalists, researchers and protestors who are at risk of being surveilled as well as targeted with online harassment and violence when they have critical information or attendance at events that may target them as human rights defenders. Along with these types of people we also focussed on when the internet is shut down or when certain information (or access to information) is censored.

_“I appreciated the civic and social focus of the workshop, which contrasts my day job where design must always be monetized for commercial purposes. The most educational part came from the feedback provided by the designers working in Internet Freedom and those with experiences of these complex  Human Rights issues. I found it valuable to directly see how different teams approached the same topic with unique processes and solutions.”_ **- Mint from Team Mojito**

---

## Local design community experts

Local design expert community groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.) should be present at the workshop to act as experts in design processes and practices but also how these processes and practices are done in the country's local context. We should not assume that design processes are the same all around the globe.

## Clear planning and agenda in OSS contribution

It's important to enable many forms of engagement in a workshop where you are aiming to investigate open source technology and make contributions. Some participants may want to work on their own machines for privacy and security reasons and also may not be comfortable connecting to insecure internet services. We also made sure that participation via writing and using sticky notes, pens and paper was prioritized. 

These methods often allow for better collaboration, communication and also spreads the risk of who added what detail and when, across a larger group of people. Paper, when digitized carefully can be more anonymous and also can be destroyed more completely than digital files that often leave a traceable trail when interacted with.

We also ensure that setting an agenda with objectives is clear from the beginning. Ensuring that there is the ability to be flexible within these times should participants want less or more time on certain activities and processes. There doesn't need to be very strict times for each activity but allowing for a minimum and a maximum time can help with planning the overall objectives of the workshop.

**The overall objective for this iteration of the workshop were:**
- Map and understand user behaviour during internet shutdowns and crisis
- Understand and explore the OSS tools ecosystem in a Taiwan context
- Ideate how OSS tools can 'fight' internet shutdowns can be designed better for Taiwanese citizens

We advise building in time to have participants that are interested in speaking out loud to the group about progress on ideas and activities that are included in an agenda plan. Sharing ideas out loud when working in smaller groups for a larger event can allow for people to be inspired by others' findings, ideas and processes which can enrich the ideas overall.

## Openness and safety

Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter of this workshop, we make sure to announce that Internet Shutdowns and Human Rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject and that we want participants to be safe. This means that we request participants to be careful with what they say, if they feel like it could put them at risk if shared outside this workshop. Additionally the organizers of the workshop or the participants may want to create their own threat/risk models and threat/risk analysis. This can be a simple written or verbal document that if a topic is discussed they may need to remove themselves from that subject or the entire workshop at that point or that they make sure to use an alias unconnected to their legal identity throughout the workshop. They can also opt out of topics and discussions and let others in the group know (with consent) what the impact could be to them if a certain topic was discussed.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20openness%20and%20safety.jpg)

_Image caption: A screengrab of the slide used in the workshop for openness and safety. The text reads: “Guiding principles and openness of results and anonymisation. Internet Shutdowns and human rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject. We want you to be as safe as possible so we encourage being careful with speaking about what we explore today. Some of these OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that national governments would prefer citizens not to access and share._

Some of the OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that certain institutions, organizations and governments would prefer citizens not to access and share. This is a critical topic to discuss in these kinds of workshops but OSS tools should only be accessed, tested and used on participants' own device if they feel comfortable and not pressured to do so by the group. Alternatively, we recommend bringing test devices with OSS tools pre-loaded on these devices to be used if possible.
We recommend participants to not share insecure contact details with each other, to be careful with disclosing any political opinions or personal details about themselves unless they are very sure that they are safe and can trust the one they're sharing with.
In the absence of experts in any area, participants who feel they have enough insight into those topics can act as experts or those questions and topics can be deferred until post workshop when answers or details can be gathered.

---

## Forming groups

There are many methods that can be used to help people form groups. We recommend that groups be no less than 3 people and no more than 6 when collaborating in a workshop environment on OSS and Internet freedom projects. It's good to encourage participants to spread out the various functions they can perform and insights they can give.
For example, you want to encourage a group to have a 2 / 2 / 2 ratio - 2 designers, 2 OSS technologists/developers and 2 Internet Freedom/NGO insights people. Some people can perform more than one of these roles (e.g. A designer might also work in an NGO or an OSS developer might also have experiences of protests) which is fine. As long as your groups have diverse experience, skills and insights and can communicate and collaborate respectfully, you have a good group.
We try to encourage people to meet new people in these workshops which can be effective in mixing up experiences, perspectives and allows for some skill sharing. We used the 'shopping list' method for mixing up teams - everyone in the room thought of an ingredient for their favorite food or drink. (e.g. 'cheese') and then 1 group leader is picked to say out loud the ingredients that makes their food of choice, out loud they will say 'I need pepperoni!' and if another person chose pepperoni they would join that team. The group leader then keeps saying ingredients for their food until they have 5-6 people and as many ingredients as they can to 'make' that food. The team's name then becomes their food type e.g. 'Team Pizza'.

## Tool landscape and tool demo

Participants attending the workshops or hackathons might not have in-depth expertise or knowledge about the kinds of tools, users or problems that the workshop hopes to tackle. This expertise is built up during the first half of the workshop from each person in the group sharing what they know with each other but also through the facilitation of the workshop. We kick off the contextual understanding of the workshop with some introductions, demos and explanations of the types of technologies and tools that can be used for the purposes of censorship circumvention and human rights activism. These don't need to be complete, comprehensive demos and you don't need to be an expert or a user of these tools (it helps if you know the basic functionality of the tools you speak about) but fundamentally, letting participants know what exists and what is technologically possible in the space already helps them to better understand the limitations and explorations of what they will investigate later.

_“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**


## Destiny

In this workshop we covered a few different technologies, a 'magic wormhole' desktop and mobile app called Destiny (made by Least Authority) that allows users to send files using unique codes that are entered into the app to verify the receiver/sender. The file only sends and receives when both the sender and receiver have the app open on an active connection at the same time. This tool ideally means that sensitive files can be sent more privately with less traceability for people involved.

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. It shows the purple and blue logo for the tool ‘Destiny’, a link to their github project page (https://github.com/LeastAuthority/destiny) and several UI screenshots from the tool showing end-to-end encryption and how devices link to each other to send files. There is a screen of Destiny that has a large button that reads ‘Select a file’ and the next screens progress through sending a file._


## Briar

The second tool we introduced is a communication, messaging and documentation tool called Briar. Briar uses bluetooth technology in short range to connect to other nearby devices that also have Briar and have been through a verification process. This tool is useful for people that need to distribute essential information to pre-approved contacts through a communication method that is harder to 'shut down' (like Wifi and mobile internet). Briar is also able to host longer articles, written text and also multiple people conversations in a 'forum' type function.

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop detailing the tool called ‘Briar’ with the project website https://briarproject.org/ and the green logo. There is an image of a phone with an animation that cycles through the UI of Briar, including the sign in page and how a user would use messaging in Briar._


## New Node

The last tool we introduced is 'New Node' which, similar to Briar, is a peer-to-peer communication tool that is harder to censor or shutdown as it connects directly to other devices with NewNode. Similar to Briar, NewNode can help people in situations where the internet is censored or shutdown make essential communications with trusted people. We also offer a 2 page document with other common tools used in internet shutdowns that participants can investigate when they get time to explore.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/refs/heads/main/workshop%20slides/The%20Design%20We%20Open%20Workshop%202023/COSCUP%202023%20-%20The%20Design%20We%20Open%20-%20newnode%202.jpg)

_Image caption: Two images of the UI of NewNode. The images show a list of contact profile pictures in circles and the message thread previews next to them that shows the most recent message from that message history. The next UI shows a message thread with one person detailing an audio file and an image file being sent as well as fire emojis being used in chat._

Finally, the room was opened up to discuss and write down tools that participants knew of that they anticipated could be useful in internet shutdown scenarios. Even if participants are not familiar with internet shutdowns or other human rights related purposes, they begin to understand the needs and circumstances that people in these human rights situations need and what technology could be useful or fundamental in such scenarios. Participants can either call these out in the room or write their own on stickies and then place them on a common area. In addition to technology or tools it is also helpful to write what it aims to do or achieve, within the human rights context.

## Why design is needed in OSS and Internet Freedom tools

One of the main purposes of encouraging designers to participate in OSS and Internet Freedom tool workshops and hackathons is that commonly, these OSS tools and Internet Freedom technologies don't have dedicated design support or design contributions. Hence these tools lack the kind of usability, design and interfaces that regular people expect from technology. They can have difficult to use interfaces, unusual settings, difficult technical language and non-supportive help text or error text. These are just some of the ways in which OSS and Internet Freedom technology can be 'lacking' in terms of design than other commonly used proprietary and commercial technologies and tools.
We focus on showing and communicating the lack of consistent design support for these technologies to help the designers present in the workshop understand the impact they will be able to make on these tools even with limited time in a workshop. Design is an underserved function across OSS and the Internet Freedom space, though there are talented and dedicated designers in the space they can be supported immensely by designers volunteering at events like these workshops. One of the fantastic things about running workshops on these topics around the globe is that these technologies are able to gain perspective from multiple citizens and user perspectives. These OSS internet freedom tools can then be designed with many cultural and contextual scenarios which makes them more usable, relevant and useful world-wide.

_“Internet Freedom and OSS technology is not so easy to use. After the workshop I recognised that some technologies are trying to be implemented for the general public and reduce its relatively high technological entry barrier.”_ **- Taro from Team Hotpot**

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: “Design in O﻿SS: Why?. Design in OSS is not new by any means! Designers and those that work on the design of OSS tools have been around since the beginning. But they might have called themselves usability experts or maybe HCI (Human computer interaction)Regardless of when designers in FL/OSS started, the trend and increase of interest for design in OSS in the last 5+ years is becoming clearer. Design is mentioned and has a presence across all technology tools in the proprietary or commercial world and more and more organizations and companies are getting on board with the design process and designers as part of technology projects._

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: “Designers are users advocates. Designers are typically focussed on ensuring that the FLOSS's users needs are being met in the way that most works for them. This might not always be a technical answer to a problem, sometimes it's about refining, clarifying and exploring alternate pathways and 'hacks' users use. Designers are there to translate those user needs for the technology they design for. Balancing 'business wants' and stakeholder needs (among other needs and wants!) is the designer's domain._

## Personas

Once the tool landscape has been explored, discussed and understood, the next critical component to explore are the users, their needs, threats and experiences. These are critical in order to better understand under what conditions the OSS, Internet Freedom technology will be used. These personas exercises help anyone, designer, developer or human rights activist explore these experiences and helps when making assumptions, asking questions about the users and coming up with hypotheses for use of the technology.
In order to optimize the time in the workshop, the facilitators created 3 user personas based on our own knowledge of similar situations and country contexts. These personas were intended to “spark ideas” and were there to be remixed and edited by workshop participants. This was the first activity the attendees worked on together in their groups. The personas could be read and used by the teams at the workshop as their 'key persona' to design and consider. What we found though, was that the participants in the workshop wanted to analyze and understand these personas, written by people outside Taiwan and then re-contextualise them in a Taiwanese way. Hence, some groups used a majority of a persona’s information and then edited small details. Other groups completely re-wrote their own personas using information from all 3 examples and also information from their own experiences of internet shutdown situations.
These new personas ended up being vital to better understanding the needs and experiences from South East Asian perspectives including folks from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Personas, when used as a device to explore needs, threats and feelings, gives anyone reading them a look at people in certain countries with certain struggles and problems. This is how designers build understanding and empathy for users and can later match technological ideas, features and improvements to goals, needs and threats of personas and then, validate whether those features help solve those problems.

_“As a team we wanted to explore the relationship between Taiwanese citizens and local journalists. The members of this team believe there are two types of journalists. The most common journalist is someone who works to gain views. Then there's also a rarer journalist that informs the public about important social issues, and serves as a watchdog to ensure transparency and accountability while working towards societal solutions.”_ **- Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

## Feedback from users and broader design challenges in the internet shutdowns space

Balancing between too much and just enough research on the users, circumstances, experiences and scenarios is tough to measure for every workshop. We included anonymised data to offer deeper insight into user and OSS technology developers/maintainers pain-points and challenges. These included complaints that the OSS technologists had heard from their own user bases such as: "This process is confusing and I don't know if I can trust the people who make the tool and who shows up as my 'friends' there" and consistent challenges like designing technology when the likelihood of a device being 'seized' (taken by police, governments or institutions in order to be searched for any illegal or sensitive information). These prompts add more detail and context to the challenges of designing and developing internet freedom technology and allow the participants to keep in mind these needs.

_“Our persona already knows how to encrypt sensitive data within images (Steganography). This creates a hidden layer of information, safeguarding it from unauthorized access. She then transfers the encrypted files onto USB drives, ensuring physical possession and reducing digital tracking. The real challenge then, if getting it to the right people”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

## Harmful or adversarial personas (personas non-grata)

We finish off the user research and user feedback evidence section by introducing the concept of an 'Adversarial Persona' or a 'Persona non-grata'. A list of the kinds of people, users and entities that can harm our good-faith and legitimate persona users are offered up, which includes persona types like 'Prankster' (someone who wants to play jokes on other users, divert their attention, distract or disturb their legitimate use) and 'Abuser' (either a romantic partner or other kind of abuser). These Adversarial Persona are useful to consider to explore the complex needs of users. It allows designers and technologists to understand what can harm their users completing key actions and what personal or institutional harm can happen to users on their own platforms. These harmful circumstances can then be accounted for and designed better so that less or none of the Adversarial Persona behaviour can affect users.

_“Taiwan's status as a high-tech hub contributes to its safety. However, while Taiwan's semiconductor industry is certainly advantageous for security, the 'silicon shield' against China is only one component of the strategy. It alone is insufficient to ensure national security.”_ **- Taro from Team Hotpot**

## User scenarios

User scenarios are an opportunity to use various personas, user feedback and design challenges that begins to tell a story of this persona's daily life, their interaction with technology and OSS tools for internet freedom purposes. These scenario statements begin to tie together details of user personas' lives and technology in a way that can lead to further exploration, isolation of a specific problem, and beginning to explore when and how technology is most and least useful.
The workshop participants are encouraged to remix and adapt these scenarios with the personas they previously chose and developed in their groups. These scenarios act as 'prompts' and ideas for the teams to consider as they build out the user and situation they want to prototype for towards the end of the workshop.

## Simulating a shutdown

*How well can we really design and develop technology if we haven't experienced what our users have experienced?*

If possible, designers and developers of any technology can find out what it's like to 'be the user'. Most people need to use the essential services and functions online that construct and run our interconnected global lives. However, there are many user experiences and scenarios that we as designers and developers may not have experienced. These are the unique 'stress cases' of users and people that do high-risk human rights and internet freedom work. We can learn more about those experiences by reading about those experiences, speaking with people with those experiences and exploring the thoughts, needs, threats and feelings of users through the exercises and activities like personas, scenarios and journeys. But, if you are able to simulate those experiences to better understand them in a safe and controlled environment then you can begin to experience the micro-decisions that people living under censorship and internet shutdowns experience too.
During this workshop, we interrupted the workshop participants to let them know that until they leave the venue that the internet has been 'shut down' and is inaccessible. Only workshop participants that need to be connected for care responsibility (like caring for the sick, elderly or children) or emergency reasons were 'allowed' to use the internet.
We asked the workshop participants to join us in experiencing what it's like when the internet is shut-down or censored. In reality, the wifi and mobile internet had not been shut-down, but we asked each of the workshop participants to place their devices into airplane mode or to turn off the wifi and mobile internet capabilities for the remaining time of the workshop.
With simulation exercises, simple or complex, you can build a more detailed understanding of how users navigate those circumstances.

_“Through exploring the journeys and users, the team was able to improve their understanding of how technical solutions can address social issues. Previously the connection was harder to discover”_ **- Sugar from Team Cake**

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: Simulating a shutdown. 1. Imagine the government has imposed a shutdown and there's no internet connection in the room. 2. Switch off the internet on your phones. Maybe even laptops. 3. This might be just a lightweight experience of an actual shutdown. 4. Try to live the scenario in the shoes of the persona you have chosen. You can let your personal experience right now guide what your persona might be going through. 5. We will run the simulation for the duration of the rest of the workshop._

## User journeys

The user journey mapping exercise is the last of the 'exploring users' exercises in this workshop plan. It typically includes conversations about the different kinds of actions and choices that can be made during a certain event, time period or meaningful interaction. For example, some groups mapped a person who had essential gathering information during a large city wide protest and some groups mapped a journalist looking to publish a story against their media outlets views. These journeys offer us a further expanded view of our user personas, finding out what they are doing when, where and how they are achieving their actions. Furthermore, how the persona is feeling and thinking during that moment can allow us better insight into how a technology experience should be designed. e.g. if a user is anxious, what can the technology do to help manage that anxiety? If a user is feeling rushed and reckless, how can technology help them make careful and well-researched decisions with their identity and information? These are the kinds of explorations that user journey mapping allows for.

During the workshop, we encouraged participants to think about the different possibilities, and to pick the route their chosen persona would most likely and logically take when faced with a user choice. There are not necessarily any incorrect routes. All routes of a user journey map are worth mapping, so that we can discover as many uses of tools as possible. It's worth understanding when facilitating a user journey mapping exercise that there are what seems to be endless possible choices users can make, both positive and negative. Ideally teams would have time to map out routes until they feel comfortable enough to progress with finding 'key moments' but it is also ok for user journey maps to have unfinished routes, decisions and questions about user behaviors. These can feed into later user research validation for technologies too.

## Discovery moments in user journeys

After finishing user journey maps participants can be feeling overwhelmed by information and options of the specific parts of a users experience to focus on. At this stage it's important to give teams a way to focus their attention on key moments depending on the purpose and objectives of your workshop. In this workshop, we wanted to attempt to isolate the key moments in the user journeys where technology is used or relied upon for an essential purpose where it may fall short of the expectation of the user. That single moment can then be focused on for the ideation and prototyping phase in order to not spread a team's attention too thinly and explore too many options. We're looking for a small, actionable moment where designing a change could have a big effect.
In our example, we show a user journey map created around a protest in a European country. The internet starts to slow down and communication methods that previously were accessible and safe are no longer so. When looking for key moments here we discovered that people would try to message friends and family and other key contacts when the internet connection begins to fail - when messages don't send and fail the behaviour that users often do is scrolling up in a chat history - we then had an idea that we could send critical info about shutdowns and protest information before the internet goes down to then be 'found' in the history via n eye catching design/text a sort of 'You won't need this info now but you will when the internet goes out, 'proactive' moment for groups sharing information.

## Ideate and design

The last activity in this workshop on design processes is ideation. After teams have identified as many key moments in their user journey and are well-informed and ready to start generating ideas, they can start with idea generation. We ask that the groups discuss the key moments and ensure they are all happy with the moment picked and then discuss the potential ideas that solve for a specific key moment for a user. These ideas can include UI, new OSS tools and technologies, and leverage existing ones. The teams are encouraged to explore more 'blue sky' thinking and less about the detailed technical feasibility and implementation. The main objective here is to explore the solutions while continually referring back to the user journeys, user scenarios and user personas to ensure that the solutions meet the needs of the users.
Participants should however, be advised to stay within the realms of technological possibility and not go into science fiction technology. The tool landscape and demos serve the purpose for grounding the reality of the technological space. During ideation teams should have a 'storyboard' layout for their idea that they think, when looking back at the user insight, solves their problems. These storyboards often communicate both the human action and the technology/device action in them. The critical element that this workshop has brought is the lived experiences of the citizens participating in the workshop.

_“Our team had the goal in mind first, then worked backwards through the user journey. The goal of the journalist is to deliver necessary information to the public in the midst of a communication shutdown.”_ **- Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

## Documentation

Finally, at the end of the workshop after everyone has had a chance to talk about their proposed solutions to their user journey key moments, we encourage the participants to document the ideas and conversations on a platform of their choice. If the host event has documentation platforms they'd like you to use or if the participants have their own platforms they'd like to use then those platforms should take priority. Documentation is communicated as an important exercise to designers and human rights activists that are not familiar with OSS practices. Documentation that is privacy respecting while being as open as possible is how this work and these ideas live on past the workshop day.
The outcomes of these kinds of workshops are far-reaching for OSS for internet freedom and human rights. There's plenty that can be learned from participants who have their own lived experience and relationships to the subject matter.

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: Wrap up﻿ and Documentation An important part of this workshop was engaging with the topic 'What if the internet was not available in a critical moment for these users?' and explore their journeys . Your work and insight can now be used to improve tools during internet shutdowns and crises. We'd like each group to speak about their persona, journey map and ideas they came up with - We'll be documenting them in the HackMD notes and you can also add details. We'll move these ideas to Github anonymously._

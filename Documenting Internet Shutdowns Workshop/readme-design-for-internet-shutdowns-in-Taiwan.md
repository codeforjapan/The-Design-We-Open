# Design for Internet Shutdowns in Taiwan: What this is?


## Documenting COSCUP's Design for Internet Shutdowns and Open Source Software workshops

In 2024 we were able to secure funding to look back towards our [workshop at COSCUP 2023](https://github.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#2023-workshop) and review, understand and communicate what we discovered through our workshop methods.

### Through our investigations we were able to discover:

1. How designers approach collaboration and contribution in an Internet Freedom and Open Source Software focused environment.
2. What design methods and processes help designers and technologists better explore user needs for complex human rights and internet freedom scenarios.
3. Contextualise and understand the Taiwanese perspectives on Internet Freedom, technology and participating in civic technology and open source software.
4. Under what conditions do technologists and designers describe contributiona nd participation in Internet Freedom technology as 'activism'.
5. Collect and present the purpose, planning, workshop structure and results to a broader audience to learn from, replicate, iterate and build upon.

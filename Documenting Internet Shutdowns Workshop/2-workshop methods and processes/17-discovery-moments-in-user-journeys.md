## Discovery moments in user journeys / 用戶旅程中的關鍵發現時刻

After finishing user journey maps participants can be feeling overwhelmed by information and options of the specific parts of a users experience to focus on. At this stage it's important to give teams a way to focus their attention on key moments depending on the purpose and objectives of your workshop. In this workshop, we wanted to attempt to isolate the key moments in the user journeys where technology is used or relied upon for an essential purpose where it may fall short of the expectation of the user. That single moment can then be focused on for the ideation and prototyping phase in order to not spread a team's attention too thinly and explore too many options. We're looking for a small, actionable moment where designing a change could have a big effect.
In our example, we show a user journey map created around a protest in a European country. The internet starts to slow down and communication methods that previously were accessible and safe are no longer so. When looking for key moments here we discovered that people would try to message friends and family and other key contacts when the internet connection begins to fail - when messages don't send and fail the behaviour that users often do is scrolling up in a chat history - we then had an idea that we could send critical info about shutdowns and protest information before the internet goes down to then be 'found' in the history via n eye catching design/text a sort of 'You won't need this info now but you will when the internet goes out, 'proactive' moment for groups sharing information.

當完成用戶旅程後，參與者往往會因為大量的資訊和用戶體驗的複雜性而感到無所適從。這時，引導團隊聚焦於工作坊的具體目標關鍵點變得尤為重要。
在我們的工作坊中，用戶旅程中那些技術應用或使用特定目的是相當重要的，尤其是無法滿足用戶期望的環節。這種方法允許我們將注意力集中在單一但至關重要的點上，為後續的構思和打造模型階段奠定基礎。我們在尋找一個小而可行的點，在那裡通過設計改變，能夠產生顯著影響。
在我們的例子中，我們展示了一個針對歐洲國家抗議活動所設計的用戶旅程圖。當網路開始變慢，以前可用且安全的通訊方法變得不再可靠。在尋找關鍵時刻時，我們發現當網路連線開始失效時，人們會試圖給朋友、家人和其他重要聯絡人發送訊息，而當訊息無法送達時，用戶經常會在聊天記錄中向上滾動。基於這一行為，我們產生了一個想法：在網路中斷之前，預先發送關於中斷和抗議的關鍵訊息，並在聊天歷史記錄中以醒目的設計或文本進行標註，這樣當網路中斷時，用戶可以在需要時輕鬆找到這些訊息。這是一個主動的時刻，提前為用戶和訊息分享提供他們在關鍵點所需的支持。

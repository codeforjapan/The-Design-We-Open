# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Personas

Once the tool landscape has been explored, discussed and understood, the next critical component to explore are the users, their needs, threats and experiences. These are critical in order to better understand under what conditions the OSS, Internet Freedom technology will be used. These personas exercises help anyone, designer, developer or human rights activist explore these experiences and helps when making assumptions, asking questions about the users and coming up with hypotheses for use of the technology.
In order to optimize the time in the workshop, the facilitators created 3 user personas based on our own knowledge of similar situations and country contexts. These personas were intended to “spark ideas” and were there to be remixed and edited by workshop participants. This was the first activity the attendees worked on together in their groups. The personas could be read and used by the teams at the workshop as their 'key persona' to design and consider. What we found though, was that the participants in the workshop wanted to analyze and understand these personas, written by people outside Taiwan and then re-contextualise them in a Taiwanese way. Hence, some groups used a majority of a persona’s information and then edited small details. Other groups completely re-wrote their own personas using information from all 3 examples and also information from their own experiences of internet shutdown situations.
These new personas ended up being vital to better understanding the needs and experiences from South East Asian perspectives including folks from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Personas, when used as a device to explore needs, threats and feelings, gives anyone reading them a look at people in certain countries with certain struggles and problems. This is how designers build understanding and empathy for users and can later match technological ideas, features and improvements to goals, needs and threats of personas and then, validate whether those features help solve those problems.

一旦工具已被充分探討、討論並理解後，下一個關鍵步驟是深入探索使用者-他們的需求、面臨的威脅和使用體驗。這些對於更全面地理解開源軟體和網路自由技術將在何種條件下使用至關重要。透過這些人物角色練習有助於設計師、開發者或人權貢獻者，都能更深入地探索這些使用體驗。並做出假設、引導我們詢問更關鍵的使用者問題，並為技術應用提出更有根據的假設。
為了優化工作坊的時間，主持人根據我們對類似情境和國家背景的了解，設計了 3 個代表性的使用者角色。這些角色旨在「啟發想法」，並供工作坊參與者重新組合和編輯。這是與會者在小組中一起進行的第一個活動。工作坊的小組可以將這些預設角色作為參考並以此定調他們的「主要角色」，用於進行設計和討論。
然而，我們發現工作坊的參與者希望分析和理解這些由非台灣人的角色，然後再以台灣的方式重塑角色。因此，有些小組使用了大部分原始的角色資訊，僅對細節進行微調。其他小組則完全徹底的重寫了角色，使用了所有 3 個範例的元素，以及融入了他們對網路中斷情況的經驗。
這些重新設計的角色設定，能讓我們更好地從東南亞視角來理解，使用者的需求和經驗，這是至關重要的，包括來自台灣、香港和中國人的觀點。當角色被用作挖掘使用者的需求、威脅和感受體驗的工具時，它能讓任何理解它們的人了解某些國家中具有特定困境和問題的人。對設計師而言，這是建立對使用者深刻理解和同理心的關鍵途徑。透過深入的洞察後續可以將技術理念、功能特性和改進與角色的目標、需求和威脅相匹配，然後驗證這些功能是否有助於解決這些使用者面臨的問題。

**“As a team we wanted to explore the relationship between Taiwanese citizens and local journalists. The members of this team believe there are two types of journalists. The most common journalist is someone who works to gain views. Then there's also a rarer journalist that informs the public about important social issues, and serves as a watchdog to ensure transparency and accountability while working towards societal solutions.” - Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Tool landscape and tool demo / 工具概覽和工具演示

Participants attending the workshops or hackathons might not have in-depth expertise or knowledge about the kinds of tools, users or problems that the workshop hopes to tackle. This expertise is built up during the first half of the workshop from each person in the group sharing what they know with each other but also through the facilitation of the workshop. We kick off the contextual understanding of the workshop with some introductions, demos and explanations of the types of technologies and tools that can be used for the purposes of censorship circumvention and human rights activism. These don't need to be complete, comprehensive demos and you don't need to be an expert or a user of these tools (it helps if you know the basic functionality of the tools you speak about) but fundamentally, letting participants know what exists and what is technologically possible in the space already helps them to better understand the limitations and explorations of what they will investigate later.


參加工作坊或黑客松的參與者可能對工作坊希望運用的工具類型、用戶或議題缺乏深入的專業知識。這些專業知識會在工作坊的前半段透過兩種方式逐步建立：小組成員之間的專業交流，以及工作坊的引導過程。
我們通過介紹、演示和解釋各種可用於規避審查和支援人權社運技術和工具，來開始建立參與者對工作坊背景的理解。這些不需要是完整、全面的，你也不需要成為這些工具的專家或使用者（如果了解所談論的工具的基本功能會更有幫助），重要的是，讓參與者了解這個領域中已有哪些現有的工具及現有的技術的基礎上可能實現什麼，可以方便他們在後續的研究上可以更好的探索。


**“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.” - Pepperoni from Team Pizza**


## Destiny

In this workshop we covered a few different technologies, a 'magic wormhole' desktop and mobile app called Destiny (made by Least Authority) that allows users to send files using unique codes that are entered into the app to verify the receiver/sender. The file only sends and receives when both the sender and receiver have the app open on an active connection at the same time. This tool ideally means that sensitive files can be sent more privately with less traceability for people involved.

在這個工作坊中，我們介紹了幾種不同的技術。首先是一個名為 Destiny 的「魔法蟲洞」桌面和移動應用程式（由 Least Authority 開發），它允許用戶使用輸入到應用程式中的唯一代碼來發送文件，以驗證接收者/發送者。只有當發送者和接收者同時在活躍連接上打開應用程式時，文件才會發送和接收。這個工具理想情況下意味著敏感文件可以更私密地發送，參與者的可追蹤性更低。

Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. It shows the purple and blue logo for the tool ‘Destiny’, a link to their github project page (https://github.com/LeastAuthority/destiny) and several UI screenshots from the tool showing end-to-end encryption and how devices link to each other to send files. There is a screen of Destiny that has a large button that reads ‘Select a file’ and the next screens progress through sending a file.

## Briar

The second tool we introduced is a communication, messaging and documentation tool called Briar. Briar uses bluetooth technology in short range to connect to other nearby devices that also have Briar and have been through a verification process. This tool is useful for people that need to distribute essential information to pre-approved contacts through a communication method that is harder to 'shut down' (like Wifi and mobile internet). Briar is also able to host longer articles, written text and also multiple people conversations in a 'forum' type function.

我們介紹的第二個工具是 Briar ，這是一款集通訊、訊息和文檔功能於一體的應用程式。Briar 使用短距離藍牙技術連接到附近同樣安裝了 Briar的裝置，這些設備是都經過驗證程序的設備。對於需要向預先認證的聯絡人分發重要訊息的人來說，需要透過更難「中斷」的通訊方式（如 Wi-Fi 和移動網路）這個工具特別有用。Briar 還能夠託管長篇的文章、書面文字，並在「論壇」類型的功能中進行多人對話。

## New Node


The last tool we introduced is 'New Node' which, similar to Briar, is a peer-to-peer communication tool that is harder to censor or shutdown as it connects directly to other devices with NewNode. Similar to Briar, NewNode can help people in situations where the internet is censored or shutdown make essential communications with trusted people. We also offer a 2 page document with other common tools used in internet shutdowns that participants can investigate when they get time to explore.

我們介紹的最後一個工具是「New Node」，它與 Briar 類似，是一種點對點通訊工具，但更難被審查或中斷，因為它直接連接到其他安裝了 NewNode 的裝置。與 Briar 類似，NewNode 可以協助用戶在網路被審查或中斷的情況下，與信任的人維持必要的的通訊。我們還提供了一份兩頁的文件，列舉了其他在網路中斷時常用的工具，供參與者在有時間研究。

Image caption: Two images of the UI of NewNode. The images show a list of contact profile pictures in circles and the message thread previews next to them that shows the most recent message from that message history. The next UI shows a message thread with one person detailing an audio file and an image file being sent as well as fire emojis being used in chat.

Finally, the room was opened up to discuss and write down tools that participants knew of that they anticipated could be useful in internet shutdown scenarios. Even if participants are not familiar with internet shutdowns or other human rights related purposes, they begin to understand the needs and circumstances that people in these human rights situations need and what technology could be useful or fundamental in such scenarios. Participants can either call these out in the room or write their own on stickies and then place them on a common area. In addition to technology or tools it is also helpful to write what it aims to do or achieve, within the human rights context.

最後，我們開放討論，讓參與者寫下他們所知道的、預期在網路中斷狀況下可能用得到的工具。即使參與者不熟悉網路中斷或其他與人權相關的議題，他們開始理解這些在網路中斷或人權相關的情況下人們的需求和處境，以及在這些場景中哪些技術可能有用或甚至發揮關鍵作用。參與者可以在教室裡分享他們的想法，或者將它們寫在便利貼上，然後放在一個公佈欄上。除了技術或工具外，也寫下他們在推動人權議題所希望達成的具體目的和用途。

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Tool landscape and tool demo / 工具概覽和工具演示

Participants attending the workshops or hackathons might not have in-depth expertise or knowledge about the kinds of tools, users or problems that the workshop hopes to tackle. This expertise is built up during the first half of the workshop from each person in the group sharing what they know with each other but also through the facilitation of the workshop. We kick off the contextual understanding of the workshop with some introductions, demos and explanations of the types of technologies and tools that can be used for the purposes of censorship circumvention and human rights activism. These don't need to be complete, comprehensive demos and you don't need to be an expert or a user of these tools (it helps if you know the basic functionality of the tools you speak about) but fundamentally, letting participants know what exists and what is technologically possible in the space already helps them to better understand the limitations and explorations of what they will investigate later.

參加工作坊或黑客松的參與者可能對工作坊希望運用的工具類型、用戶或議題缺乏深入的專業知識。這些專業知識會在工作坊的前半段透過兩種方式逐步建立：小組成員之間的專業交流，以及工作坊的引導過程。
我們通過介紹、演示和解釋各種可用於規避審查和支援人權社運技術和工具，來開始建立參與者對工作坊背景的理解。這些不需要是完整、全面的，你也不需要成為這些工具的專家或使用者（如果了解所談論的工具的基本功能會更有幫助），重要的是，讓參與者了解這個領域中已有哪些現有的工具及現有的技術的基礎上可能實現什麼，可以方便他們在後續的研究上可以更好的探索。

**“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.” - Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Introduction and framing the workshop / 工作坊的介紹與框架

When beginning the workshop, there must be a welcoming and inviting feeling. Many designers have not experienced the Free and Open Source (FOSS or OSS) space or gained much experience with the Internet Freedom, Human rights technology or censorship circumvention technology space. The OSS and Human Rights technology space share many commonalities and the development and coding practices are familiar to each other, but design in both these spaces are rare. Ensure that workshop participants are welcome to bring their own thoughts, critique and experience as well as asking detailed and basic questions is welcome.
This workshop can be attended by designers, coders, developers, technologists and those interested in OSS or involved in OSS. It's also good for journalists, human rights defenders, civic technologists or people who work at NGOs or charities that are committed to a non-political/non-partisan, human rights inclusive approach. People involved in 'Big Tech', surveillance technology or who are politically aligned can also join these workshops, especially if they are openly accessible and available, but the framing of the workshop should be clearly communicated that we are prioritizing privacy, security and digital human rights globally with this work.


工作坊應以營造友善和歡迎的氛圍為首要任務。許多設計師可能對自由開源軟體（FOSS 或 OSS）、網路自由、人權科技或反審查技術等領域尚感陌生。雖然 OSS 和人權科技領域在開發和寫code實踐上有諸多相似之處，但這兩個領域內的設計層面的工作仍屬少見。因此，我們需要確保參與者能夠自在地分享想法、提出建議和分享經驗，同時鼓勵他們提出各種問題，無論是細微的還是基本的。
這個工作坊歡迎多元背景的參與者，包括：
1. 設計師、寫code的人、開發者和技術專家
2. 對 OSS 感興趣或已參與 OSS 的人士
3. 記者、人權捍衛者和公民科技工作者
4. 在非政治性/非黨派性、注重人權的非政府組織或慈善機構工作的人員
我們也歡迎來自科技公司、監控技術領域的從業者或具有政治傾向的人士參加，尤其是在工作坊以公開且自由參與的前提下。然而，我們會明確傳達工作坊的核心宗旨：優先考慮全球的隱私、安全和數位人權。

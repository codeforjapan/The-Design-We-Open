# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Internet freedom tool experts / 網路自由工具專家

These can be designers, technologists or people who have worked/volunteered in the NGO, Internet Freedom, Journalism or Civic Technology space. They offer insight into the complex and nuanced challenges faced by those institutions and individuals doing human rights advocacy and work. The areas of knowledge are broad and it's best to look for people with knowledge in a specific type of human rights depending on the focus of the workshop. For example, our workshop in 2023 focussed on experiences of journalists, researchers and protestors who are at risk of being surveilled as well as targeted with online harassment and violence when they have critical information or attendance at events that may target them as human rights defenders. Along with these types of people we also focussed on when the internet is shut down or when certain information (or access to information) is censored.

這類專家可能來自非政府組織、網路自由、新聞業或公民科技領域，包括設計師、技術專家或其他相關人員。他們的價值在於：
- 深入理解人權倡導工作中的複雜挑戰
- 提供特定人權領域的專業知識
- 分享實際案例和經驗
例如，2023 年的工作坊聚焦於：
1. 記者、研究人員和社運者面臨的風險，如監視、網路騷擾和暴力
2. 網路中斷關閉和訊息審查的應對策略
這樣的專家組合能確保工作坊涵蓋理論和實踐，為參與者提供全面的學習體驗。

_“I appreciated the civic and social focus of the workshop, which contrasts my day job where design must always be monetized for commercial purposes. The most educational part came from the feedback provided by the designers working in Internet Freedom and those with experiences of these complex  Human Rights issues. I found it valuable to directly see how different teams approached the same topic with unique processes and solutions.”_ **- Mint from Team Mojito**

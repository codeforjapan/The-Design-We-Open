# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Documentation / 文件紀錄

Finally, at the end of the workshop after everyone has had a chance to talk about their proposed solutions to their user journey key moments, we encourage the participants to document the ideas and conversations on a platform of their choice. If the host event has documentation platforms they'd like you to use or if the participants have their own platforms they'd like to use then those platforms should take priority. Documentation is communicated as an important exercise to designers and human rights activists that are not familiar with OSS practices. Documentation that is privacy respecting while being as open as possible is how this work and these ideas live on past the workshop day.
The outcomes of these kinds of workshops are far-reaching for OSS for internet freedom and human rights. There's plenty that can be learned from participants who have their own lived experience and relationships to the subject matter.

最後，在工作坊結束時，在每個人都有機會分享他們針對用戶旅程關鍵點提出的解決方案後，我們鼓勵參與者在他們選擇的平台上記錄這些想法和對話。如果主辦活動有指定的文件記錄平台，或是參與者有偏好的平台，則應優先使用這些平台。文件紀錄對於不熟悉開源軟體的設計師和人權活動人士來說，是一個非常重要的過程。文件紀錄應該在尊重隱私的前提下，公開分享工作坊成果，以確保這些工作和想法在工作坊結束後能夠持續發揮影響力。

這類工作坊的成果對於推動開源軟體在網路自由及人權領域的發展具有深遠影響。我們能與從參與者的真實經歷及其與相關議題的連結中獲得寶貴的見解。

The text reads: Wrap up﻿ and Documentation An important part of this workshop was engaging with the topic 'What if the internet was not available in a critical moment for these users?' and explore their journeys . Your work and insight can now be used to improve tools during internet shutdowns and crises. We'd like each group to speak about their persona, journey map and ideas they came up with - We'll be documenting them in the HackMD notes and you can also add details. We'll move these ideas to Github anonymously._

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Local design community experts / 本地設計社群專家

Local design expert community groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.) should be present at the workshop to act as experts in design processes and practices but also how these processes and practices are done in the country's local context. We should not assume that design processes are the same all around the globe.

建議應邀請當地設計社群（如 IxDA、Ideo、Ladies that UX 等）的專家參與工作坊，這些專家不僅熟悉設計流程和實踐，還了解這些流程在本地文化背景中的應用。我們不應假設設計流程在全世界都是一致的。

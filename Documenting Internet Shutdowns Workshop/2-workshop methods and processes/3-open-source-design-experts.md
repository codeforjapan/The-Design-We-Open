# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Open source design experts / 開源設計專家

People who work on or have contributed to OSS generally are valuable participants of this workshop. They are able to give insight and context on OSS culture, communication and expectations across a broad selection of OSS projects. They can also typically operate and use the interfaces and processes needed to contribute to OSS more quickly and effectively than those completely new to these but also can support and teach other participants at the workshop how to use OSS processes and functions e.g. how to submit an issue, how to create a branch, how to install, run and use an OSS project/tool.

OSS 領域的從業者或貢獻者是工作坊的寶貴資產。他們可以：
- 提供 OSS 項目的深入洞見和背景知識
- 分享 OSS 文化、溝通方式和社群期望
- 熟練操作 OSS 貢獻流程和工具
- 指導新手使用 OSS 流程，如提交問題、創建分支、安裝和使用 OSS 項目等

_“I was curious about open-source software and found the internet shutdown scenario. This experience has reinforced my view of GitHub as a collaborative platform where developers can gain valuable insights on their projects. I have created my own OSS project since the workshop.”_ **- Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

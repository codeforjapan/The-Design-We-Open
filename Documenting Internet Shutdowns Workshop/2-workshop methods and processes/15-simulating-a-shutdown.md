# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Simulating a shutdown / 模擬網路中斷

*How well can we really design and develop technology if we haven't experienced what our users have experienced?*

If possible, designers and developers of any technology can find out what it's like to 'be the user'. Most people need to use the essential services and functions online that construct and run our interconnected global lives. However, there are many user experiences and scenarios that we as designers and developers may not have experienced. These are the unique 'stress cases' of users and people that do high-risk human rights and internet freedom work. We can learn more about those experiences by reading about those experiences, speaking with people with those experiences and exploring the thoughts, needs, threats and feelings of users through the exercises and activities like personas, scenarios and journeys. But, if you are able to simulate those experiences to better understand them in a safe and controlled environment then you can begin to experience the micro-decisions that people living under censorship and internet shutdowns experience too.
During this workshop, we interrupted the workshop participants to let them know that until they leave the venue that the internet has been 'shut down' and is inaccessible. Only workshop participants that need to be connected for care responsibility (like caring for the sick, elderly or children) or emergency reasons were 'allowed' to use the internet.
We asked the workshop participants to join us in experiencing what it's like when the internet is shut-down or censored. In reality, the wifi and mobile internet had not been shut-down, but we asked each of the workshop participants to place their devices into airplane mode or to turn off the wifi and mobile internet capabilities for the remaining time of the workshop.
With simulation exercises, simple or complex, you can build a more detailed understanding of how users navigate those circumstances.

*如果我們沒有體驗過成為用戶的經驗，我們真的能很好地設計和開發技術嗎?*

如果可能的話，任何技術設計師和開發人員能夠親身體驗「成為用戶」的感受時。大多數人使用日常構建我們互聯生活的基本線上服務和功能。然而，但設計師和開發人員往往未曾經歷過那些在高風險人權和網路自由領域工作的人所面對的獨特「壓力案例」。透過了解這些經歷、與當事人對話，並利用角色扮演、情境模擬和用戶旅程分析等方式，以及活動來探索用戶的想法、需求、威脅和感受，從而了解更多關於這些經歷的資訊。但是，如果你能夠在安全和被監控的環境中模擬這些經歷以更加地能夠感受，從而開始體驗生活在審查制度和網路中斷下的人們所經歷的微觀決策。
在這次工作坊中，我們告知參與者在活動結束前，「網路已被中斷」，無法連接。只有因照顧責任（如照顧病人、老人或兒童）或緊急原因需要連線的參與者才「允許」使用網路。
我們邀請參與者共同體驗在網路被中斷或審查時的感受。實際上，Wi-Fi 和手機熱點並未被關閉，但我們請每位參與者在剩餘的工作坊時間內，將他們的設備設定為飛行模式，或關閉 Wi-Fi 和手機熱點功能。
通過簡單或複雜的模擬練習，你可以更詳細地了解用戶如何在這些情況下導航。

Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: Simulating a shutdown. 1. Imagine the government has imposed a shutdown and there's no internet connection in the room. 2. Switch off the internet on your phones. Maybe even laptops. 3. This might be just a lightweight experience of an actual shutdown. 4. Try to live the scenario in the shoes of the persona you have chosen. You can let your personal experience right now guide what your persona might be going through. 5. We will run the simulation for the duration of the rest of the workshop.

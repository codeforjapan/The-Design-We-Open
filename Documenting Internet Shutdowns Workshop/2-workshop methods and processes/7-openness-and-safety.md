# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Openness and safety / 開放性與安全性

Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter of this workshop, we make sure to announce that Internet Shutdowns and Human Rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject and that we want participants to be safe. This means that we request participants to be careful with what they say, if they feel like it could put them at risk if shared outside this workshop. Additionally the organizers of the workshop or the participants may want to create their own threat/risk models and threat/risk analysis. This can be a simple written or verbal document that if a topic is discussed they may need to remove themselves from that subject or the entire workshop at that point or that they make sure to use an alias unconnected to their legal identity throughout the workshop. They can also opt out of topics and discussions and let others in the group know (with consent) what the impact could be to them if a certain topic was discussed.

_Image caption: A screengrab of the slide used in the workshop for openness and safety. The text reads: “Guiding principles and openness of results and anonymisation. Internet Shutdowns and human rights in technology is a difficult and dangerous subject. We want you to be as safe as possible so we encourage being careful with speaking about what we explore today. Some of these OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that national governments would prefer citizens not to access and share._

Some of the OSS tools are used to actively allow citizens to access and share information that certain institutions, organizations and governments would prefer citizens not to access and share. This is a critical topic to discuss in these kinds of workshops but OSS tools should only be accessed, tested and used on participants' own device if they feel comfortable and not pressured to do so by the group. Alternatively, we recommend bringing test devices with OSS tools pre-loaded on these devices to be used if possible.
We recommend participants to not share insecure contact details with each other, to be careful with disclosing any political opinions or personal details about themselves unless they are very sure that they are safe and can trust the one they're sharing with.
In the absence of experts in any area, participants who feel they have enough insight into those topics can act as experts or those questions and topics can be deferred until post workshop when answers or details can be gathered.

鑑於此次工作坊涉及網路中斷和人權科技這類敏感話題，我們重視參與者的安全。我們將提醒參與者在發言時謹慎考慮，避免透露可能在工作坊外危及自身的資訊。工作坊的組織者和參與者也可以建立自己的避險套路，以便在討論到敏感話題時做出適當的應對，例如退出討論或使用與合法身份無關的別名。
一些 OSS 工具被積極用於促進公民獲取和分享某些敏感資訊，因此，在工作坊中討論這些工具時，應尊重每位參與者的舒適度。如果可能，建議攜帶預裝 OSS 工具的測試設備，以便在需要時進行使用。
為了保障安全，建議參與者避免互相分享不安全的聯繫方式，並在不確定對方可信任度的情況下謹慎透露政治觀點或個人詳細資訊。如果在某些領域缺乏專家，可以邀請熟悉相關主題的參與者暫時擔任專家角色，或者將這些問題留待工作坊後進一步探討。

# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Facilitators / 引導者

For this workshop, it is important to have some different sectors and expertise present. We recommend local design groups (e.g. IxDA, Ideo, Ladies that UX etc.), OSS designers and/or coders, developers or maintainers of those OSS projects and designers who are experts in the internet freedom, human rights and censorship circumvention technology space. Facilitation should ideally be shared between these groups and done by those who feel most comfortable and able to facilitate in an engaging and clear way towards the designers and technologists participating in the workshop.

工作坊的成功關鍵在於融合多元領域的專業知識。我們建議邀請以下專家：
1. 當地設計社群代表（如 IxDA、Ideo、Ladies that UX 等）
2. OSS 設計師和/或寫code的人
3. OSS 項目的開發者或維護者
4. 網路自由、人權和反審查技術領域的專業設計師
工作坊引導應由這些群體共同分擔，優先選擇能夠以吸引人和清晰方式帶領參與者的人。

**“In the team, most people identified as engineers, one person had some design training but was not currently in a design job role. However, they ended up playing a key facilitation role between the engineer discussions and keeping the focus on the users.” - Sugar from Team Cake**

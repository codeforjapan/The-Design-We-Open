# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## User journeys / 用戶旅程

The user journey mapping exercise is the last of the 'exploring users' exercises in this workshop plan. It typically includes conversations about the different kinds of actions and choices that can be made during a certain event, time period or meaningful interaction. For example, some groups mapped a person who had essential gathering information during a large city wide protest and some groups mapped a journalist looking to publish a story against their media outlets views. These journeys offer us a further expanded view of our user personas, finding out what they are doing when, where and how they are achieving their actions. Furthermore, how the persona is feeling and thinking during that moment can allow us better insight into how a technology experience should be designed. e.g. if a user is anxious, what can the technology do to help manage that anxiety? If a user is feeling rushed and reckless, how can technology help them make careful and well-researched decisions with their identity and information? These are the kinds of explorations that user journey mapping allows for.

During the workshop, we encouraged participants to think about the different possibilities, and to pick the route their chosen persona would most likely and logically take when faced with a user choice. There are not necessarily any incorrect routes. All routes of a user journey map are worth mapping, so that we can discover as many uses of tools as possible. It's worth understanding when facilitating a user journey mapping exercise that there are what seems to be endless possible choices users can make, both positive and negative. Ideally teams would have time to map out routes until they feel comfortable enough to progress with finding 'key moments' but it is also ok for user journey maps to have unfinished routes, decisions and questions about user behaviors. These can feed into later user research validation for technologies too.

用戶旅程反思練習是本工作坊計劃中「探索用戶」活動的最後一環。這一練習通常涉及討論在某特定事件、時間軸或有意義的互動中，用戶可能採取的各種行動和選擇。例如，一些小組反思了在大規模城市抗議中收集重要信息的經歷，而另一些小組則探討了記者如何報導與主流媒體觀點相左的故事。這些旅程為我們提供了更深入的用戶角色視角，幫助我們了解他們在何時、何地以及如何完成他們的行動。同時，分析用戶在這些時候的情感和思考，可以讓我們更好地設計出符合他們需求的科技體驗。例如，如果用戶感到焦慮，科技應該如何幫助他們緩解壓力？如果用戶在行動中感到匆忙或衝動，科技又該如何幫助他們在管理身份和訊息時做出更謹慎、深思熟慮的決策？這些就是用戶旅程映射所能探索的價值所在。
在我們的工作坊中，我們鼓勵參與者深入思考多種可能性，並選擇最符合所選角色邏輯的行動路線。這裡的關鍵理念是：沒有所謂的"錯誤"路線。每條路徑都具有其獨特的價值，因為它們不僅展現了工具的多樣化用途，還反映了用戶行為的複雜性。
用戶旅程映射的精華在於認識到用戶選擇的多樣性和難以預測的本質。可能出現的正面和負面結果。理想情況下，團隊應有充足時間探索各種可能的路線，直到他們能夠自如地到達到「關鍵時刻」。然而，我們也要理解，未完成的路線、尚未決定的結果，以及對用戶行為的種種疑問，都是正常且可以接受的。

The template includes a section at the top ‘Purpose’, the ‘Persona’ ‘The goal of the exercise’ and the ‘Scenario’ that is being user journey mapped. The template is separated into ‘touch points’ to describe the events of a time-period and then ‘What happened?’ ‘How did you feel?’ ‘How did you think?’ ‘What or who was involved?’


## Discovery moments in user journeys / 用戶旅程中的關鍵發現時刻

After finishing user journey maps participants can be feeling overwhelmed by information and options of the specific parts of a users experience to focus on. At this stage it's important to give teams a way to focus their attention on key moments depending on the purpose and objectives of your workshop. In this workshop, we wanted to attempt to isolate the key moments in the user journeys where technology is used or relied upon for an essential purpose where it may fall short of the expectation of the user. That single moment can then be focused on for the ideation and prototyping phase in order to not spread a team's attention too thinly and explore too many options. We're looking for a small, actionable moment where designing a change could have a big effect.

In our example, we show a user journey map created around a protest in a European country. The internet starts to slow down and communication methods that previously were accessible and safe are no longer so. When looking for key moments here we discovered that people would try to message friends and family and other key contacts when the internet connection begins to fail - when messages don't send and fail the behaviour that users often do is scrolling up in a chat history - we then had an idea that we could send critical info about shutdowns and protest information before the internet goes down to then be 'found' in the history via n eye catching design/text a sort of 'You won't need this info now but you will when the internet goes out, 'proactive' moment for groups sharing information.


當完成用戶旅程後，參與者往往會因為大量的資訊和用戶體驗的複雜性而感到無所適從。這時，引導團隊聚焦於工作坊的具體目標關鍵點變得尤為重要。
在我們的工作坊中，用戶旅程中那些技術應用或使用特定目的是相當重要的，尤其是無法滿足用戶期望的環節。這種方法允許我們將注意力集中在單一但至關重要的點上，為後續的構思和打造模型階段奠定基礎。我們在尋找一個小而可行的點，在那裡通過設計改變，能夠產生顯著影響。
在我們的例子中，我們展示了一個針對歐洲國家抗議活動所設計的用戶旅程圖。當網路開始變慢，以前可用且安全的通訊方法變得不再可靠。在尋找關鍵時刻時，我們發現當網路連線開始失效時，人們會試圖給朋友、家人和其他重要聯絡人發送訊息，而當訊息無法送達時，用戶經常會在聊天記錄中向上滾動。基於這一行為，我們產生了一個想法：在網路中斷之前，預先發送關於中斷和抗議的關鍵訊息，並在聊天歷史記錄中以醒目的設計或文本進行標註，這樣當網路中斷時，用戶可以在需要時輕鬆找到這些訊息。這是一個主動的時刻，提前為用戶和訊息分享提供他們在關鍵點所需的支持。

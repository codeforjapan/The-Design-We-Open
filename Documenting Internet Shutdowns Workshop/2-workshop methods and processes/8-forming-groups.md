# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Forming groups / 分組

There are many methods that can be used to help people form groups. We recommend that groups be no less than 3 people and no more than 6 when collaborating in a workshop environment on OSS and Internet freedom projects. It's good to encourage participants to spread out the various functions they can perform and insights they can give.
For example, you want to encourage a group to have a 2 / 2 / 2 ratio - 2 designers, 2 OSS technologists/developers and 2 Internet Freedom/NGO insights people. Some people can perform more than one of these roles (e.g. A designer might also work in an NGO or an OSS developer might also have experiences of protests) which is fine. As long as your groups have diverse experience, skills and insights and can communicate and collaborate respectfully, you have a good group.
We try to encourage people to meet new people in these workshops which can be effective in mixing up experiences, perspectives and allows for some skill sharing. We used the 'shopping list' method for mixing up teams - everyone in the room thought of an ingredient for their favorite food or drink. (e.g. 'cheese') and then 1 group leader is picked to say out loud the ingredients that makes their food of choice, out loud they will say 'I need pepperoni!' and if another person chose pepperoni they would join that team. The group leader then keeps saying ingredients for their food until they have 5-6 people and as many ingredients as they can to 'make' that food. The team's name then becomes their food type e.g. 'Team Pizza'.

有許多方式可以協助分組，在以開源軟體和網路自由為主題的工作坊中進行專案協作時，我們建議小組人數介於3到6人之間。推薦鼓勵參與者以他們的能發揮工作項目來提供見解。
例如，你可以鼓勵每組維持2/2/2的比例 ： 2名設計師、2名開源專家/開發人員和2名網路自由//非營利組織顧問 。有些人可以擔任多重角色(例如，設計師也可能在非政府組織工作，或者開源軟體開發人員也可能有參與社運的經驗)，這是可以的。關鍵在於小組擁有多樣化的經驗、技能和見解，並且能夠以互相尊重的方式進行溝通與協作，就可以說是一個理想的小組。
我們試圖鼓勵人們在這些工作坊中結識新朋友，這可以有效地促進經驗、觀點的交流，並有機會讓技能共享。我們採用了"購物清單"的分組方式 - 我們讓每個人都想到他們最喜歡的食物或飲料中的一種配料。(例如「起司」)，接著挑選1位小組組長，請他大聲說出構成他們選擇的食物的配料，他們可能會說：「我需要意大利辣香腸!」如果有人選擇了意大利臘腸，他們就會加入那組。小組組長會繼續喊出食物的配料，直到他們有5-6個人，同時盡可能列舉更多配料來「製作」那道美食。最後，團隊以他們的食物命名，例如「披薩隊」。這種方法不僅能打破陌生感，還能在歡樂的氛圍中自然而然地形成多元化的小組。

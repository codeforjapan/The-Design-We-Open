# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Ideate and design / 構思與設計

The last activity in this workshop on design processes is ideation. After teams have identified as many key moments in their user journey and are well-informed and ready to start generating ideas, they can start with idea generation. We ask that the groups discuss the key moments and ensure they are all happy with the moment picked and then discuss the potential ideas that solve for a specific key moment for a user. These ideas can include UI, new OSS tools and technologies, and leverage existing ones. The teams are encouraged to explore more 'blue sky' thinking and less about the detailed technical feasibility and implementation. The main objective here is to explore the solutions while continually referring back to the user journeys, user scenarios and user personas to ensure that the solutions meet the needs of the users.

Participants should however, be advised to stay within the realms of technological possibility and not go into science fiction technology. The tool landscape and demos serve the purpose for grounding the reality of the technological space. During ideation teams should have a 'storyboard' layout for their idea that they think, when looking back at the user insight, solves their problems. These storyboards often communicate both the human action and the technology/device action in them. The critical element that this workshop has brought is the lived experiences of the citizens participating in the workshop.


在這次以設計流程為主題的工作坊中，最後一項活動是構思。在團隊辨識了用戶旅程中的關鍵點，並對其有充分了解後，他們就可以開始進行想法的生成。我們鼓勵小組討論這些關鍵點，並確保對所選的重點達成共識，再針對用戶的特定關鍵點探索潛在解決方案。這些想法可以包括用戶介面、新的開源工具和技術，或是對現有技術的靈活運用。團隊被鼓勵採用更多「自由發想」，不必過於拘泥於技術細節或實施的可行性。這項活動的核心目標是，不斷參照用戶旅程、情境和用戶角色的同時，探索能夠滿足用戶需求的解決方案。
然而，參與者應被提醒要保持在技術可行性的範疇內，不要超出現實進入科幻技術的領域。工具範疇和展示的目的是將思考範圍落實在現有的技術空間中。在構思階段，團隊應為他們的想法設計「分鏡腳本」，從用戶洞察的角度出發，解決他們面臨的問題。這些分鏡腳本通常同時表達了人類行為和技術／設備行為之間的互動。這次工作坊的一個關鍵要素是參與者所帶來的真實生活經驗。

Image caption: A solution prototype from Team Mojito that shows illustrations of using a USB and wifi (before a shutdown) to record data and information about critical news events or organising details. This USB then asks users to install an app to view a sandbox in order to view the information. To get the USB this would be passed between people using a passphrase.

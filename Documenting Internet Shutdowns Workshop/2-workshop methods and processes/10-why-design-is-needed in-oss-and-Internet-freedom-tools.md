## Why design is needed in OSS and Internet Freedom tools / 
為什麼開源軟體（OSS）和網際網路自由工具需要設計

One of the main purposes of encouraging designers to participate in OSS and Internet Freedom tool workshops and hackathons is that commonly, these OSS tools and Internet Freedom technologies don't have dedicated design support or design contributions. Hence these tools lack the kind of usability, design and interfaces that regular people expect from technology. They can have difficult to use interfaces, unusual settings, difficult technical language and non-supportive help text or error text. These are just some of the ways in which OSS and Internet Freedom technology can be 'lacking' in terms of design than other commonly used proprietary and commercial technologies and tools.
We focus on showing and communicating the lack of consistent design support for these technologies to help the designers present in the workshop understand the impact they will be able to make on these tools even with limited time in a workshop. Design is an underserved function across OSS and the Internet Freedom space, though there are talented and dedicated designers in the space they can be supported immensely by designers volunteering at events like these workshops. One of the fantastic things about running workshops on these topics around the globe is that these technologies are able to gain perspective from multiple citizens and user perspectives. These OSS internet freedom tools can then be designed with many cultural and contextual scenarios which makes them more usable, relevant and useful world-wide.

鼓勵設計師參與開源軟體和網際網路自由工具的工作坊及黑客松的主要原因，是因為這些工具往往缺乏專業的設計支持與貢獻。由於缺少設計資源，這些工具在可用性、設計和介面上常常難以達到一般使用者對科技產品的期望。它們可能擁有不易操作的介面、不直觀的設定、晦澀難懂的技術語言，以及缺乏說明文字或錯誤的提醒。這些問題使得開源軟體和網際網路自由技術在設計方面，相較於商業專有技術工具存在明顯差距。
我們致力於向工作坊中的設計師展示這些技術在設計上的不足，幫助他們理解即便在工作坊的短暫時間內，他們的設計貢獻也能產生顯著影響。設計在開源軟體和網際網路自由領域是一個被忽視的環節，儘管這個領域中已經有不少才華洋溢且充滿熱情的設計師，但通過這類活動中的志願設計貢獻，可以為他們提供更多的支持。
在全世界舉辦此類主題工作坊的一大優勢在於，可以從不同國家的公民和使用者角度中獲取寶貴的見解。這些開源的網際網路自由工具因此能在設計過程中融入多元的文化和情境，使其在世界各地更具其可用性、相關性和實用性。

_“Internet Freedom and OSS technology is not so easy to use. After the workshop I recognised that some technologies are trying to be implemented for the general public and reduce its relatively high technological entry barrier.”_ **- Taro from Team Hotpot**

Designers and those that work on the design of OSS tools have been around since the beginning. But they might have called themselves usability experts or maybe HCI (Human computer interaction)Regardless of when designers in FL/OSS started, the trend and increase of interest for design in OSS in the last 5+ years is becoming clearer. Design is mentioned and has a presence across all technology tools in the proprietary or commercial world and more and more organizations and companies are getting on board with the design process and designers as part of technology projects._

_Image caption: A screengrab image of a slide from the workshop. The text reads: “Designers are users advocates. Designers are typically focussed on ensuring that the FLOSS's users needs are being met in the way that most works for them. This might not always be a technical answer to a problem, sometimes it's about refining, clarifying and exploring alternate pathways and 'hacks' users use. Designers are there to translate those user needs for the technology they design for. Balancing 'business wants' and stakeholder needs (among other needs and wants!) is the designer's domain._

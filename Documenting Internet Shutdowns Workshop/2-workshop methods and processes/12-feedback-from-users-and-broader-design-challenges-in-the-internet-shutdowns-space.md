# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Feedback from users and broader design challenges in the internet shutdowns space / 使用者回饋和網路中斷領域中更廣泛的設計挑戰

Balancing between too much and just enough research on the users, circumstances, experiences and scenarios is tough to measure for every workshop. We included anonymised data to offer deeper insight into user and OSS technology developers/maintainers pain-points and challenges. These included complaints that the OSS technologists had heard from their own user bases such as: "This process is confusing and I don't know if I can trust the people who make the tool and who shows up as my 'friends' there" and consistent challenges like designing technology when the likelihood of a device being 'seized' (taken by police, governments or institutions in order to be searched for any illegal or sensitive information). These prompts add more detail and context to the challenges of designing and developing internet freedom technology and allow the participants to keep in mind these needs.

在每次工作坊中，我們面臨著一個持續的挑戰：如何在有限的時間內，適度地深入研究使用者、他們所處的情境、使用體驗以及可能遇到的各種場景。我們納入了匿名數據，讓我們能夠更深入地洞察使用者以及開源軟體技術的開發者和維護者所面臨的痛點與挑戰。這些包括開源技術專家從他們自己的使用者中聽到的抱怨，比如：「這個過程令人困惑，我不知道是否可以信任開發這個工具的人，以及在那裡在平台上顯示為我的『朋友』的人」，以及一些持續存在的挑戰，例如在設備可能被「扣押」（被警察、政府機構強制沒收以搜尋任何非法或敏感資訊）。在這情況下。這些回應為設計和開發網路自由技術的挑戰增添了更多細節和背景要素，使參與者能夠時刻牢記這些需求。

She then transfers the encrypted files onto USB drives, ensuring physical possession and reducing digital tracking. The real challenge then, if getting it to the right people” - Pepperoni from Team Pizza**

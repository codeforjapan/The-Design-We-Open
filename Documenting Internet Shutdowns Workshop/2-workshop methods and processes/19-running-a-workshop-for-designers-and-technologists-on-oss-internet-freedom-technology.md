# Executive Summary

## Running a workshop for designers and technologists on OSS Internet Freedom technology

If you find yourself inspired to run a workshop for designers, OSS maintainers, technologists and Internet Freedom activists after reading this we have resources available in an Open Github repository: https://github.com/sprblm/The-Design-We-Open/tree/main. You can also find an [open virtual whiteboard]([url](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM3Baplg=/)) https://bit.ly/DesignatCOSCUP  (We use Miro.com for our workshop plans and resources). We make sure to build workshop content that is inclusive of people new to design processes in open source. The intersection of design, open source software and internet freedom technology is small but growing and we make content that is accessible and helps grow understanding of each other.

We encourage you to use whatever resources and structures work for you and your communities. If you’d like support or advice on how to plan and run a workshop then you can contact us on the following email hi@superbloom.design. Superbloom staff have planned and facilitated design and OSS contribution workshops internationally and are particularly interested in how we bring more designers and design practices into the open source software community and the internet freedom and human rights technology space.

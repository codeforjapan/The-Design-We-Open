# Workshop Methods and processes / 工作坊的方法和過程

## Clear planning and agenda in OSS contribution / OSS 貢獻的明確規劃和議程

It's important to enable many forms of engagement in a workshop where you are aiming to investigate open source technology and make contributions. Some participants may want to work on their own machines for privacy and security reasons and also may not be comfortable connecting to insecure internet services. We also made sure that participation via writing and using sticky notes, pens and paper was prioritized. 

These methods often allow for better collaboration, communication and also spreads the risk of who added what detail and when, across a larger group of people. Paper, when digitized carefully can be more anonymous and also can be destroyed more completely than digital files that often leave a traceable trail when interacted with.

We also ensure that setting an agenda with objectives is clear from the beginning. Ensuring that there is the ability to be flexible within these times should participants want less or more time on certain activities and processes. There doesn't need to be very strict times for each activity but allowing for a minimum and a maximum time can help with planning the overall objectives of the workshop.

**The overall objective for this iteration of the workshop were:**
- Map and understand user behaviour during internet shutdowns and crisis
- Understand and explore the OSS tools ecosystem in a Taiwan context
- Ideate how OSS tools can 'fight' internet shutdowns can be designed better for Taiwanese citizens

We advise building in time to have participants that are interested in speaking out loud to the group about progress on ideas and activities that are included in an agenda plan. Sharing ideas out loud when working in smaller groups for a larger event can allow for people to be inspired by others' findings, ideas and processes which can enrich the ideas overall.

主旨在研究和貢獻開源技術的工作坊中，為參與者提供多元的參與方式相當重要。一些參與者可能基於隱私和安全考慮，更希望在自己的裝備上操作，並避免連接到不安全的網路連線。因此，我們將優先考慮非數位化的參與方式，如書寫、便利貼、筆和紙。這些方法不僅能促進更好的協作與溝通，還能在保護隱私的同時分散風險，避免數位足跡的留下。當需要數位化時，我們將謹慎處理紙本資料，以確保其匿名性。

我們將從一開始就明確設置議程和目標，並在時間安排上保持彈性，以便參與者就需要調整各項活動的時間。雖然每項活動不必嚴格限制時間，但設置最短和最長的時限有助於達成工作坊的整體目標。

本次工作坊的主要目標為：
- 繪製並理解用戶在網路中斷和危機期間的行為模式。
- 探索和理解在台灣背景下的 OSS 工具生態系統。
- 設計出適合台灣公民應對網路中斷的 OSS 工具。

我們建議在議程中安排分享環節，讓有興趣的參與者向大家報告進展和想法。這能促進跨組的經驗交流，讓所有人從其他人的結論和觀點中汲取靈感。

# Executive Summary

Designers have a crucial role to play in the internet freedom open-source ecosystem. This report describes the importance of designers working on technology for high-risk contexts, as explored during a hands-on workshop at COSCUP 2023 and follow-up workshop at COSCUP 2024. 

Open-source software (OSS) teams provide a crucial resource to activists in high-risk environments by offering privacy and security tools that help them organize safely. However, many users struggle with the complexity of OSS tools. They often look and feel different than "standard" big tech tools, which can make them challenging to figure out: not only are the privacy settings and security features different, there are systemic barriers making collaboration between OSS developers and designers more difficult. Design is often not considered or supported in the internet freedom OSS funding landscape. The predominant collaboration platforms are not optimized for design contributions. However, events like this one can help to bring designers and developers together, leading to tools that are both functional and intuitive.

COSCUP, a major open-source conference in Taiwan, is free to attend and run by volunteers from the Taiwanese open-source community. Since 2006, COSCUP has been a forum for community-building around internet freedom, privacy, and security, with a particular emphasis on people who are at high risk due to their political activities. Taiwan has strong free speech protections, which allows COSCUP to hold a neutral space for discussion and problem-solving. Taiwan's worldwide ranking for internet freedom is high, with a 90.7% internet penetration rate and a strong civic tech community promoting transparency. Taiwan is also an important use case for internet freedom OSS tools. Given Taiwan's geopolitical relationships and risks of natural disaster, developing tools for preparedness and resilience is at the forefront of many COSCUP workshops and hackathons.

At COSCUP 2023, Superbloom conducted a workshop on ‘Designing for Human Rights and Internet Freedom OSS,’ where participants created user personas, journey maps, and strategies to address digital restrictions. These outputs were documented, translated into Chinese, and published on GitHub for accessibility and continuity. In this report, we lead readers through the process and outputs of the workshop: the schedule, the activities, and the outputs of each team. 

However, our aim is not just to report on a single workshop, but to provide a blueprint for similar workshops connecting the dots between design and internet freedom. We supply a starter pack to encourage readers of this report to convene a similar workshop of their own. We make suggestions for the logistical aspects of workshop preparation (who to invite, what kind of space to use) as well as including activities and methods you may want to use. We hope that this documentation serves to bring people together in the name of bringing usability and accessibility to internet freedom OSS tools, in Taiwan and worldwide.

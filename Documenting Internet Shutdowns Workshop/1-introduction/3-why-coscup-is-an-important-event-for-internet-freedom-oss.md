# Why COSCUP is an important event for Internet Freedom OSS / 為什麼 COSCUP 是網路自由 OSS 的重要活動

COSCUP is one of the biggest and important international open source events in Taiwan. It receives a high number of participants interested not only in tech but also design which makes it a great spot for discourse from critical perspectives of people involved in building solutions for internet freedom i.e. technologists and designers. COSCUP is also very welcoming and offers flexibility in tailoring workshops and discussions around open source and internet freedom topics. 

COSCUP, being held in Taiwan, also offers a neutral or rather a more positive space (geographically) with a freedom of speech and freedom of press to talk and spread ideas concerning sensitive topics such as the human rights especially those of the marginalized communities who are most in need of internet freedom tools and technologies to protect their privacy and security digitally. There are also other organizations and individuals in Taiwan working on complex issues of human rights  and building civic technologies. If anything, there needs to be a greater involvement among such persons. Most countries surrounding Taiwan may not offer the same level of freedom. This makes COSCUP an important event for internet freedom OSS in South East Asia and broader parts of Asia. 

The need for privacy, security and finding ways to stay connected as a community in the face of internet instability is also very real for the Taiwanese. They recognize their relationship with CCP, they understand the natural calamity can impact their infrastructure and hence believe in staying prepared. From our experience of running workshops in COSCUP, these have been key problem areas that the participants chose to design their solutions for. 

COSCUP 是台灣最大且最重要的國際開源活動之一，吸引了大量不僅對技術感興趣，還對設計感興趣的參與者。這樣的參與者組成使 COSCUP 匯聚了技術人員、設計師等，提供了一個絕佳的平台。讓他們能從不同的角度進行深入討論。此外，COSCUP 也非常友善且有彈性， 以「開源」與「網路自由」為核心，來設計工作坊與研討會議程。

COSCUP 在台灣舉辦，提供了一個更中立或更積極的空間（地理位置上），在這裡享有言論自由和新聞自由，可以討論和傳播有關敏感議題的想法，如人權問題，尤其是那些最需要網路自由工具和技術來保護其數位隱私和安全的弱勢群體。台灣還有其他組織和個人在致力於解決複雜的人權問題和開發公民科技。事實上，這些人之間需要有更高度的參與與機會合作。先對於周邊國家，台灣提供了相對開放的環境，使 COSCUP 成為東南亞及更廣泛亞洲地區網路自由與開源軟體領域的指標性會議。

對於台灣人來說，深切感受到網路不穩定的影響，同時對個人隱私與安全存有高度的關注。他們清楚認知與中國共產黨的關係，並理解自然災害可能會影響其基礎設施，因此注重做好準備。根據我們在 COSCUP 舉辦工作坊的經驗，這些問題一直是許多參與者選擇設計解決方案的核心重點。

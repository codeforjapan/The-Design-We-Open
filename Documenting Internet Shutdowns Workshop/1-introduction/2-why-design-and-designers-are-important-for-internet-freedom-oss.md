# Why Design and designers are important for Internet Freedom OSS / 為什麼設計和設計師對於網路自由 OSS 很重要

The enthusiasm that technologists express when speaking about human rights, civic tech and privacy and security tools is admirable. They create and configure these tools, advocate for their use and their continual improvement with a passion that is frequently connected to a very real and intense life experience. Yet when you speak to the users of these tools, ordinary people, not especially technologically experienced, though experienced enough to know that they need these tools in order to stay safe, private and independent you hear the similar passion for human rights sprinkled with moderate to large amounts of frustration. 

- *“Why can’t the privacy settings be more clear and understandable?”*

- *“It’s so difficult to communicate to the people we train in digital privacy that to be safe, they have to switch VPN sometimes. It’s hard to communicate why”*

- *“Well I use these tools for my journalism reporting but, honestly I still use big techs communication tools too, even though I know it’s risky they are easier to use and my family won’t switch to secure tools.”*

Technologists notice these issues from their users as critical usability bugs in their technologies. Here is where designers and their design practices can mitigate problems for users and equalize the access and use of critical human rights and civic technologies. Designers seek to prioritize both expert and novice use of technology.

Designers and their practices bridge the experiences between tool developers and citizen users. It should never be a requirement to fully comprehend the technologies inner workings in order to use it to be safe. Here is the bridge designers and technologists in partnership build to bring users across, towards safe and secure existence and interaction with tech. Designers humanize the needs and purposes of technology in order to make it useful across a spectrum of global daily life experiences. Designers want to, by their very practice, include and make accessible. Designers, when given the opportunity to use design practice to do good, will do good.

Yet the barriers for designers and design practice to be normalized in Internet Freedom OSS technology are great. Design practice often registers as less vital than technological skills. Less budgeted for, less respected, less served by online collaboration platforms yet in design practice is where the interaction between the lived experience of the human meets technology and is humanized. Humanising technology and understanding these high risk, complex human rights defenders experiences is where we find the focus of the design events and hackathons like those hosted at COSCUP.

技術人員在人權、公民科技和隱私安全工具領域的熱忱令人欽佩他們開發並讓這些工具可更加完善，源自於真切而深刻的生活體驗。然而，一般用戶雖然認知到這些工具的必要性，卻常常感到無力：然而，當你與這些工具的普通用戶交談時，你會發現他們對人權同樣熱忱，卻又夾雜著不同程度的無力感。這些用戶雖不精通科技技術，但深知這些工具對保障自身安全、隱私和獨立的重要性。

- 「為何隱私設置不能更直觀？」
- 「向學員解釋為何安全需要時常切換VPN，這很困難」
- 「雖然我在寫稿中使用較具安全性的工具，但日常還是會用一般大品牌的通訊軟體，因為它們更方便，家人也不願改用安全工具。」

這些問題被技術人員視為嚴重的易用性bug。而設計師的專業正能彌補這一問題，讓重要的人權和公民科技工具更易於使用和普及。設計師致力於兼顧專業技術用戶和新手的需求。
設計師搭建了開發者和用戶間的橋樑。擁有較高的安全性不應以完全理解內部運作的技術為前提。設計師和技術專家合作，引導用戶在具安全隱私保護性下地與科技互動。他們將技術需求人性化，使之適應全世界各種日常場景。設計師的核心理念是包容性和普遍性，他們渴望通過設計實踐造福社會。
然而，設計在網路自由開源軟體領域的重要性仍未得到充分認可。與技術技能相比，設計實踐常被視為次要，獲得的資源和重視度較低。但正是在設計中，人類經驗與技術相融，實現了人性化。理解高風險、複雜的人權捍衛者的需求，正是COSCUP等設計活動和黑客松的核心。

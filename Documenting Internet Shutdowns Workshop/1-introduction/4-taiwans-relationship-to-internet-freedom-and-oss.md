# Taiwan's relationship to internet freedom and OSS / 台灣的網路自由與開源軟體現狀

*What are the threats to internet freedom in Taiwan and what do regular people and technologists think about internet freedom?*

Taiwan is widely recognized for its high level of internet freedom, ranking sixth globally and first in Asia according to Freedom House's 2023 report. With an internet penetration rate of 90.7% as of January 2024, Taiwanese citizens view internet access as a fundamental right. This freedom has fostered a vibrant civic tech community that collaborates with the government to promote transparency and openness.

However, Taiwan faces unique challenges to its internet freedom. The country is on the frontline of China's "Cognitive Warfare," which includes disinformation campaigns, military intimidation, and influence operations. These threats have put pressure on Taiwan's online information ecosystem, potentially manipulating public opinion and threatening the integrity of its digital spaces.
The open source software (OSS) community in Taiwan has responded to these challenges by developing locally-focused projects. Many of these initiatives, like the fact-checking bot Cofacts, are designed to address Taiwan-specific issues and are deeply integrated into popular local platforms. While this approach effectively serves the Taiwanese context, it can make these tools difficult to replicate in other countries.

台灣的網路自由度享譽全球，在自由之家2023年報告中位列全球第六、亞洲第一。截至2024年1月，台灣網路普及率高達90.7%，全民視網路使用權為基本權利。這樣的自由環境孕育了蓬勃的公民科技社群，與政府攜手推動政策透明度和開源開放。

然而，台灣面臨獨特的挑戰。作為抵禦中國「認知戰」的最前線，台灣須應對包括假訊息傳播、軍事威脅和影響力操作等威脅。這些因素不僅衝擊台灣的網路，還可能影響公眾輿論，危及數位空間的完整性。
為應對這些挑戰，台灣開源（OSS）社群積極開發本土專案。如事實查核機器人Cofacts等項目，專門針對台灣特有問題設計，並與本地主流平台深度整合。這種方法雖然在台灣環境中有亮眼的成效，但可能難移植到其他國家。

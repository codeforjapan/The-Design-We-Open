A. **Scenario:** This team focussed initially on the aspect of internet shutdown sparked by a 'war' like conflict scenario, as a location based phenomena. Meaning that, as well as starting with a persona type, they also focused on the fact that when an internet shutdown occurs, what goes missing is the ability to communicate across significant physical distances. The internet enables us to, with a stable connection, speak to anyone that we have a method of contact for, anywhere that they may be provided they have connection and at any time provided they are able to check their devices/communication methods.

**情境：** 這個團隊最初關注的是由「戰爭」類衝突引發的網路中斷情境，以地點為基準的現象。也就是說，除了從角色開始，他們關注當網路中斷發生時，失去的是跨越實際距離進行通訊的能力。網路能讓我們能夠在連線穩定的情況下，與我們有聯繫方式的任何人交談，無論他們在何處，只要他們有連線，而且在任何時候，只要他們能夠檢視他們的設訊通訊。

B. **Persona:** Wangxiaming a taxi driver in his late 50s without too much tech knowledge in the face of war.

**角色：** 王小明，一位年近50歲的計程車司機，在遭逢戰爭時對科技知識了解不多。

C. **Context:** As the team focused their explorations on access and mobility potential and the behaviors associated with transit/taxi drivers they then began to explore the social motivations, communication patterns/access, preparation work and finally, the difficult subject of trust and verification. This surfaced from inquiry around critical information being moved by individuals that might have their own agendas or views on the social issue causing the internet shutdown.

**背景：** 隨著團隊將研究重點放在交通和流動力以及與公共交通/計程車司機相關的行為上，他們開始探討關於通勤流動/計程車司機的社會動機的準備工作，最後是對信任訊息和驗證訊息的困難主題。這源於對重點資訊被可能有自己想法或對網路中斷的社會議題有自己看法的人所影響。

D. **Goal:** There are certain people that have local, non-internet connections and communications and city-wide mobility (e.g. Taxi drivers and truck drivers). How can these methods be leveraged in an internet shutdown scenario.

**目標：**  有些人擁有當地的非網路連線和通訊方式，以及具城市級的流動性（例如計程車司機和卡車司機）。在網路中斷的情況下，如何利用這些方法。

E. **Solution finding:** The focus of their explorations therefore became centred on the need of mobility and consistent movement throughout a location (city or district) and what kinds of people do this activity already surfaced the critical user persona of a transit driver or a taxi driver. These citizens also can have access to alternative methods of communication that do not always rely on internet connectivity, such as closed networks of  walkie-talkies and radio communications.

The team had a number of areas they could have focused an OSS technology intervention on, including:
- How do we recognise critical citizens before a crisis that leads to an internet shutdown (e.g. taxi drivers) and prepare them ahead of that crisis to locate, verify and disseminate information.
- How do people verify and trust information, what are their methods of critical deduction when it comes to information that preserves lives. 
- Similarly, how does information spread both naturally and when more engineered? How can this make its way to people that are not as technologically adept. 
- Once correctly informed and safe, what do citizens then do? What are the next steps in safety, returning to normal life or what are the likely next steps for citizens post crisis.

There was also a concern that taxi drivers may be generous enough to move messages around in limited circumstances or times they care about the issues but ultimately they are sacrificing income to do a messenger role and perhaps they would need some payment for this.
A large general realization among the designers and technologists participating was that in an internet shutdown, typical technology that most people are comfortable using no longer functions at all or as intended. They quickly realized that technology that doesn’t rely on internet connectivity might be older, more complicated to set up and use and less instant. Which led to a shift in users that are not ordinarily the focus of. 

Upon further discussion with the team members, we discovered that there are many detailed and nuanced aspects that only get lightly mentioned in a 1 day workshop around internet shutdown technologies. One topic was whether or not there are topics that the demographic user of ‘transit/taxi driver’ would refuse to spread, such as issues more connected to younger people like feminist issues, women’s rights and political beliefs and alignment. A potential solution to this though was ‘locked’ information so the drivers did not know the contents of the message. This was also risky for them though given concern over ‘illegal’ information.

From Superbloom’s design expert perspective this group discovered a user persona that is underserved in the OSS internet shutdowns prevention technology. Personas which do not automatically self-align with technology and/or information or news spreading are rare in this sector. The focus on the pre-crisis phase, sometimes described as the ‘training phase’ also tends to underserved these kinds of citizens and typically it is hard to engage those not technologically curious in prevention and resilience technology. The use of technologies such as bluetooth (for sharing information/files), walkie talkie applications, radios and paper based couriered messages while astute also reveals that more can be done to help designers and understand the capabilities for technology in these scenarios. The presence of technologists helped this greatly as many shared their own knowledge of tools and technologies beyond that of Superbloom’s examples, especially technologies that were incubated in Taiwan. 

However, like many prototypes are, they’re only the first step in a potential avenue for improvement in technology. The benefits of this team’s insight are in focusing on the margins where under represented groups, scenarios and circumstances rise. These are the aspects that OSS censorship circumvention and internet shutdown technologies can learn from generally. How to communicate these insights though, reveals the gap between design practice and OSS technology. Methods for designers who create outputs like this sorely need clearer avenues to signal to relevant technologies and stakeholders.

**解決方案：** 因此，他們探索的重點集中在對一個地點（城市或區域）內的流動性和持續移動的需求，以及什麼樣的人已經有這樣的活動行為，浮現出大眾交通的司機或計程車司機這種重要角色。這些民眾也可以使用不時常依賴網路連線的替代通訊方法，如封閉的對講機網絡和無線電。

團隊有幾個地方可以是開源的，包括：
- 我們如何在導致網路中斷的危機發生之前辨別關鍵民眾（如計程車司機），並在危機來臨之前將他們定位、驗證和傳播訊息。
- 民眾如何驗證和資訊的可信度，當涉及到生命安全相關的訊息時，他們的想法和主張會是什麼。
- 同樣，資訊是如何自然傳播的，以及當更有計劃時如何傳播？這些資訊如何傳達給不太懂科技的人。
- 一旦正確獲得資訊並安全後，民眾接下來會做什麼？當大家都安全、回歸正常生活的下一步是什麼，或者民眾在危機後可能的下一步會是什麼。

這個團隊最初聚焦於由「戰爭」類似衝突場景引發的網路中斷，作為一種基於位置的現象。這意味著，除了從persona 開始,他們還關注於當網路中斷發生時，失去的進行通訊的能力。網路使我們能夠在網路穩定的情況下,與任何我們有聯繫方式的人交談，無論他們在何處、何時只要他們有網路都能夠查看他們的通訊工具。因此,討論重點集中在需要能在一個地點(城市或區域)內持續移動的需求上，而哪些人已經在做這樣的事，產生了公車司機或計程車司機這一類型的關鍵用戶persona。這些民眾也使用不高度依賴網路連線的通訊方式,如對講機和無線電通訊的封閉網路。隨著團隊將討論重點放在擁有持續移動性公車/計程車司機相關的行為上，他們開始探索動機、通訊模式、準備工作，最後是關於信任和驗證證訊息正確性困難的主題討論。這源於傳遞關鍵資訊的人有可能有自己的一套想法或對導致網路中斷的社會議題有自己個人的看法。
團隊有幾個可以讓開源技術參與的項目
包括:
- 如何在導致網路中斷的危機之前找出關鍵民眾(如計程車司機)，並在危機發生前準備他們的地點位置、驗證和傳播信息。
- 人們如何驗證和信任訊息，在涉及保護生命的資訊時,他們的結論推斷的依據是什麼。
- 同樣，信息如何自然擴散以及如何更有計劃地傳播?這如何教授給不太精通科技的人。
- 一旦正確安全地接獲悉，民眾接下來會做什麼?在大家都安全、恢復正常生活的下一步是什麼,或者在危機過後民眾有可能採取的下一步是什麼。
還有一個擔憂是，計程車司機可能在有限的情況下或他們關心的問題上慷慨地傳遞消息，但最終他們是會犧牲收入來扮演傳遞訊息的角色，也許他們需要一些報酬。
參與的設計師和技術含量高的參與者普遍意識到，在網路中斷的情況下，大多數人習慣使用的典型科技完全無法運作或無法按預期運作。他們很快注意到，不依賴網路連接的技術可能更老舊、建置和更難使用和更複雜，反應也不那麼即時。這導致焦點轉到了使用者身上，這在一般來說並不頻繁。經過與團隊成員的進一步討論,我們發現在一天的工作坊中,關於網路中斷,有許多細節和過程的方面只能被快速地提及。其中一個話題是「公車/計程車司機」這一群體是否有拒絕傳播的可能，比如與年輕人更相關的議題，如女權、婦女權利和政治信仰及立場。一個有可能的解決方案是「鎖住」資訊，這樣司機就不知道消息的內容。但考慮到「非法」資訊的擔憂，這對他們來說也是有風險的。

_“The team emphasized the importance of this multi-faceted approach: In a crisis like flooding or other natural disasters, we need to ensure that everyone, regardless of their access to technology, can receive and understand life-saving information. High-risk information, such as content related to war, political issues, or rumors, is particularly sensitive. People are often hesitant to share this kind of information because of the varying political stances and interpretations that can lead to conflicts. Many individuals are unwilling to support or deliver any message that could be perceived as a political agenda.”_ **- Pepper from Team Japanese Curry**

A. **Scenario:** There's been a protest that the government is attempting to stop.

**情境:** 政府正試圖阻止一場示威遊行

B. **Persona:** Journalist/Citizen journalism

**角色：** 記者/公民記者

C. **Context:** This team focused on events similar to the Umbrella Movement. At the beginning of the protest scenario, our journalist/citizen journalist arrives at the scene, ready to report on the unfolding events. The atmosphere is tense as demonstrators gather, with the government threatening to shut down internet access to quell the protest. As our protagonist prepares to document the situation, they're suddenly faced with a communication blackout as the internet goes out. They need to be able to collect and share information without  being tracked.

**背景：** 團隊專注於類似雨傘運動的事件。在示威遊行開始時，我們的記者/公民記者抵達現場，準備報導正在發生的事件。當示威者聚集時，氣氛十分緊張，政府威脅要切斷網路以阻止示威遊行。當我們的主角準備記錄情況時，他們突然面臨通訊中斷，因為網路被切斷了。他們需要能夠在不被發現的情況下收集和分享信息。

D. **Goal:** Successfully communicate with each other to gather for protest in the midst of internet shutdown. The journalist needs to be able to collect accurate information and inform as many people as possible.

**目標：** 在網路中斷的情況下成功的溝通，以集結抗議。他們需要能夠收集準確的信息並傳送盡可能更多的消息給其他人。

E. **Solution finding:** Team started their design journey by picking a protest scenario first, followed by selecting the journalist/citizen journalist persona. In the middle of the chaos of protest, our journalist must quickly adapt to this new challenge. They realize the critical need to share vital information such as media files, contacts, messages along with information about protest meeting locations and police movements, but traditional communication channels are no longer available. This is where they begin to explore alternative methods of information sharing, tapping into technologies like FireChat, NFC, Bluetooth, and fingerprint authentication. NFC and bluetooth are tech developments that a person naturally gravitates towards when considering no internet scenarios. But also the team structure had more engineers over designers which also indicates why the solution is tech-first. A vital moment in the journey of the user when they need to use this solution the most is when the police arrive to break apart the protest and people need to find a way to evade them so they share information such as the police location, safe protest places or any other information in their phone etc… Therefore, this team considered a solution where they could bump their phone against another person thereby transferring a packet of information. While it is an interesting idea because of the ease of use in a crowded setting and ensuring they send the information to the specific trusted person, it still raises questions about what if the phone is bumped into the wrong person in a chaotic setting or concerns of ensuring that there’s no spread of misinformation. This led to discussions about finding the right, trusted authority who would be the source of the information. The journalist works with fellow protesters to establish a decentralized network, allowing them to pass verified information securely without relying on internet connectivity.

In a different line of thought to make their solution reach more people, the team would have preferred if there was a way to use existing lines of communication such as the Line app itself for such a scenario and purpose. If Line app could introduce offline capabilities, that would make it easier because people are already used to the app. 

During solutions thinking it is often easy to go in various directions, sometimes unproductively and so it is important to keep the user and their journey in mind at all times. Sugar recounted the same happening in their group where she being the only one related to the design field used the design journey to align the group and their solution around the user. 

**解決方案：** 團隊首先選擇了一個示威遊行的情境，然後選擇了記者/公民記者的角色。在示威遊行的混亂中，我們的記者在短時間內了解這個新的狀況：在斷網中，需要傳送訊息、文件、影音、聯絡人資訊等以及有關抗議集會地點和警察動向的關鍵需求，但傳統的通訊渠道已不再可用。Cake團隊想到可利用FireChat、NFC、藍牙和指紋認證等技術。NFC和藍牙是人們在考慮無網絡情況時自然會想到的技術發展。但同時，團隊結構中工程師多於設計師，這也是為什麼解決方案是以技術為主。在用戶最需要使用此解決方案的關鍵時刻是當警察到達驅散示威時，人們需要找到方法躲避他們，所以他們會分享諸如警察位置、安全示威地點或手機中的任何其他信息等。

另外的解決方案，可以將手機碰撞到另一個人的手機上，從而傳輸一則訊息。這個方案，適合在擁擠的環境中使用，並確保他們將信息發送給特定的人，但它仍然還有一些問題，像是如果在混亂的環境中手機碰到了不對的人，或者怎麼確保信息的正確信。這讓他們有對可信的訊息來源做更近一步的討論。記者與其他示威者合作建立一個去中心化的網絡，允許他們在不依賴網路的情況下安全地傳遞經過驗證的信息。

在另一個方案中，為了讓他們的解決方案觸及更多人，團隊希望能夠在這種情況使用台灣人已經慣用的app，如Line本身。如果Line能夠引入離線功能，使用上將會對台灣的民眾更加的便利及順手也會增加普及度。

在思考解決方案時，往往容易朝各個方向發展，有時甚至會偏離正軌，因此始終牢記用戶及其歷程至關重要。Sugar 回憶起他們小組也發生了同樣的情況，作為唯一一個與設計領域相關的成員，她運用設計歷程來調整小組方向，並使解決方案圍繞用戶展開。

A. **Scenario:** A Chinese computer engineer and civic journalist, whose investigative paper has drawn government scrutiny, faces imminent arrest. He must escape to another country to ensure his safety and that of his family.

**情境：** 一位中國電腦工程師兼公民記者，因其調查報告引起政府關注，面臨即將被逮捕的危險。他必須逃往另一個國家以確保自己和家人的安全。

B. **Persona:** An academic user persona - Computer Engineer and Civic Journalist. Team Mojito chose this persona because they read about a similar case in the news. The familiarity helped them relate to the person's situation better.

**角色：** 一位電腦工程師兼公民記者。Mojito團隊選擇這個角色是因為他們在新聞中讀到過類似的案例。這種熟悉感幫助他們更好地理解這個人的處境。

C. **Context:** The journalist%E2%80%99s paper exposed sensitive government information which has caused protests and unrest. He must try to escape the country safely, securing travel documents, and arranging safe passage for himself and his loved ones. Since he cannot use regular and common means of transport, he needs to find a way to cross the border via land. Through his journey he is unable to access the internet and must be cautious to maintain privacy, keep his whereabouts and identity hidden.

**背景：** 這位記者的報告揭露了敏感的政府資訊，引發了抗議和動亂。他必須試圖安全地逃離國家，獲取旅行證件，並為自己和親人安排安全通道。由於他不能使用常規和一般的交通方式，他需要找到一種通過陸路越境的方法。在他的逃亡中，他無法使用網路，必須謹慎行事以保持隱私，隱藏自己的行蹤和身份。

D. **Goal:** To escape and secure a safe and discreet exit from the country for himself and his family.

**目標：** 為自己和家人逃離並確保安全和謹慎地離開出境。

E. **Solution finding:** The team explored and evaluated the need for multiple tech solutions to bring this persona to succeed. He would need a method to communicate with his trusted sources and contacts. He would need some safe houses or checkpoints to break his journey. And he would need to be out of sight of authorities and the army.
 
Since this case is not a common occurrence, building specific technologies for this persona may not be feasible, hence he needs to use already existing tools, technologies and methods to plan his escape. As a result of the user journey mapping and brainstorming, the team Mojito came up with the following ideas:

_Offline connectivity in Taiwan:_ Establish a local network using devices connected via a Wi-Fi router. When the internet is cut off, the network automatically switches to mesh mode, enabling continued communication and connectivity among devices.

_Escape documentation and safety navigation:_ In an escape situation, use a hiking app in offline mode that has radar functionality. This app allows users to request updates from others about safe locations verified by NGOs(more neutral entities), helping navigate to secure areas. 

_Virtual message box system:_ Use a secure virtual message box where both parties agree on a long code. To communicate, each person places a message in the box, which can only be accessed and read by entering the agreed code. 
While these are all great ways to think about the solution, this needs further development in terms of how to stay connected in remote areas i.e. how does the mesh network enable connectivity when there are lesser devices available in the region. The solution also raised questions about who the team considered to be the ideal authority to ensure the security of the messages? Responses from the team members varied, while some suggested politicians they trust, others recommended NGOs for their credibility. 

We were curious about what types of information might be the most sensitive. Mint noted that in a scenario of government repression, individuals employed by the government would likely be the primary targets. The focus is not on the specific information being monitored but on how certain professions naturally increase the risk of being targeted.

**解決方案：** 團隊評估了多種技術解決方案，這位逃亡者需要一種與安全訊息通信的方法。他需要一些安全的地點或躲避所來作為逃亡的過濟站。他還需要避開當局和線民的視線。由於這種情況並不常見，為這個角色建立特定的科技技術可能不太可行，因此他需要使用已有的工具、技術和方法來計劃逃跑。通過使用者旅程和腦力激盪，Mojito團隊提出了以下想法。

_台灣的網路中斷連線：_ 建立一個使用通過Wi-Fi連接器連接設備的本地網絡。當網路被切斷時，網路自動切換到網狀模式，使設備之間能夠繼續通訊和連線。

_逃亡文件和安全導航：_ 在逃亡情況下，使用具有雷達功能的離線模式的登山應用程式。這個應用程式允許用戶或其他人向由非政府組織（更中立的機構）發射出關於安全位置的更新的驗證訊息，幫助導航到安全區域。

_虛擬留言系統機：_ 使用一個安全的虛擬留言機，雙方同意一個長的代碼。為了通訊，每個人在機器裡放一則訊息，只有輸入約定的代碼才能進入和看訊息。
雖然這些都是思考解決方案的好方法，但在偏遠地區如何保持連接方面還需要進一步的研究，即當該地區可用設備較少時，網狀網絡如何實際連線。該解決方案還引發了關於團隊認為誰是確保訊息安全的理想官方的問題。團隊成員的回答不盡相同，有些人建議他們信任的政治家，其他人則推薦非盈利組織，因為它們更可信。

我們好奇什麼類型的信息可能是最敏感的。Mint指出，在政府鎮壓的情況下，幫政府工作的人可能是主要目標。重點不在於被監控的具體訊息，而在於某些職業自然會增加被針對的風險。

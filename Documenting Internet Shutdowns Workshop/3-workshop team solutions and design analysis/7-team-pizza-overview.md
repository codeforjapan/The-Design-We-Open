A. **Scenario:** The user persona has critical information that they want to report, yet the act of reporting is repressed by a media outlet that could be worried about national or international governmental backlash. Along with this systemic worry there is the possible social pressure from citizens, organizations and entities aligned with the perpetrator and not the victim.

情境：使用者角色擁有他們想要報導的關鍵資訊，但報導的文章被一家媒體機構所抵制，該機構擔心來自國內或國際政府的反彈。除了這種擔憂外，還有來自民眾、社會組織和與加害者而站在同一陣線的實際的社會壓力。

B. **Persona:** Journalist/Citizen journalist. This team focussed on the user persona that has gained critical information about an important, national or international issue and wants to make sure that both citizens and appropriate people in power have access to this information. The team explored the ways that journalists and citizen journalist personas might face challenges like misinformation and disinformation campaigns as well as malicious entities that look to discredit or erase the information and evidence from existence. In our experience as designers working on many projects that face censorship and shutdowns, these personas face targeted attacks and, if an issue is suitably volatile enough, a government or other entity can look to shutdown or throttle internet services or perform targeted censorship. This persona has a high intensity existence once they have obtained information they wish to make public and it becomes important quickly to move away from ordinary, yet insecure internet and communications practices towards privacy and security preserving ones.

角色：記者/公民記者。這個團隊聚焦於一個使用者角色，該角色獲得了關於重要的國家或國際議題的關鍵訊息，並希望確保民眾和適當的有權人士都能獲取這些資訊。團隊討論了記者和公民記者角色可能面臨的挑戰，如錯誤訊息和假消息攻擊，以及試圖抹黑或消滅資訊和證據的惡意組織。這個角色面臨著針對性攻擊，如果一個議題足夠敏感，政府或其他組織可能會試圖關閉或限制網路通訊，或進行有針對性的審查。一旦這個主角獲得了他們希望公布的新聞，他們的生活就會變得高度緊張，迅速從普通但不安全的網路和通訊方式轉向保護隱私和安全的形式就變得非常重要。

C. **Context:** The journey that the user persona went on it%E2%80%99s necessarily an obvious internet shutdown scenario e.g. war, disaster, malicious entity removing connectivity. It surfaces as more social and technological censorship and intimidation. To publish is to make a target of one's self and this journey encapsulates the experience of an individual who's media outlet does not train or support their safety and that meets this risk not in a hypothetical scenario first, but a real scenario.

背景：這段使用者旅程並不是一個明顯的網路中斷場景，例如戰爭、災難或惡意實際切斷網路連線。它更多地呈現被社會和數位科技的管制監控和威脅。發表文章即是將自己暴露在風險之中，而這段旅程描述了一個新聞媒體機構讓個人有機會冒著此風險並不提供安全保護或支援，尤其這是在現實生活中實際發生，而非假設情境下。

D. **Goal:** To share essential news and information in a way that cannot be traced back to a specific individual through any kind of tracking.

目標： 在以任何追蹤方式都無法追溯到特定個人的行蹤，以此前提下的方式來分享重要的新聞和資訊。

E. **Solution finding:** The team identify a number of points in a journey where technology can intervene:

- Helping the journalist persona to find out who is likely to be monitoring/surveilling them.
- Supporting the journalist persona to still use certain words and terms online and offline without raising alarm or risk further monitoring.
- Helping the journalist persona camouflage or hide critical information on their story ‘in plain sight’ and transfer that through safe, secure online methods that do not require use of compromised internet or internet connection altogether.

Plenty of exploration was done by the group to find physical locations for information to spread as well as how that information can be trusted, verified and obfuscated by ‘passing through many hands’. Here is where the designers encountered the critical aspects of privacy and security alongside an internet shutdown scenario.

The final prototype made was a USB device that could contain vital news, articles and information related to a topic that is possible to have a recognisable logo on. The USB, once opened, would access a ‘proxy’ or ‘sandbox’ to open the relevant files for individuals to read. This ‘sandbox’ was prototyped to work both online and offline. There are still many questions related to trust of devices like USB drives and the risk of malware and viruses on these devices. These in depth topics though would require more user research, exploration and prototype iterations beyond a single day workshop. 

Interestingly, the members of this team we spoke to were interested because of the focus on OSS, privacy, security and internet shutdown issues and attended in order to explore those ideas in a group setting. They commented further that if you’re not a privacy and security engineer or specialist, speaking about and having input or thoughts on these topics felt ‘inaccessible’ without that knowledge and authority. Notably, a member of this team went on to change their study major to engineering and started their own OSS project shortly after the workshop.

解決方案：團隊確定了科技技術可以介入的幾個旅程點：

- 幫助記者角色找出誰可能正在監視/監控他們。
- 支持記者角色在線上和線下仍然使用某些用字和術語，而不引起警報或增加進一步監控的風險。
- 幫助記者角色在「明處」偽裝或隱藏關於他們故事的關鍵訊息，並通過安全、可     靠的線上方式傳送資訊，這些方法完全不需要使用被中斷的網路或通訊。

用戶persona經歷的旅程並不一定是明顯的網路中斷場景，例如戰爭、災難、惡意機構中斷連線。它更多地表現為社會和技術審查的恐嚇。用戶persona擁有他們想要報導的重要新聞，但報導卻被國家或國際政府反彈的媒體機構所壓制。除了這種國家機器系統性的擔憂，還有來自與加害者相關的公民、組織和機構的社會壓力。公布新聞意味著讓自己成為攻擊的目標，這個旅程概括了一個個人的經歷，他們的媒體機構並不培訓保護或支援保護他們的安全，而且他們首次面對這種風險不是在假設的說法下，而是在現實生活中。

最終打造的模型是一個可以包含與某個主題相關的重要新聞、文章和訊息的USB工具，可能帶有可辨識別的標籤。一旦打開USB，它會進到一個「代理伺服器」或「安全機制」來開箱相關文件供個人閱讀。這個「安全機制」被設計成可以在線上和線下工作。關於USB驅動器等工具的信任以及這些設備上惡意軟體和病毒的風險仍然存在許多問題。不過，這些深入的主題需要更多的用戶研究、探索和原型擬，超出了單日工作坊的負荷範圍。

有趣的是，我們談到的這個團隊的成員對開源軟體、隱私、安全和網路中斷問題的感到興趣，並參加工作坊以在團隊的形式來探索這些想法。他們進一步回饋說，如果你不是隱私和安全方面的工程師或專家，在沒有這些知識和力量的情況下，討論和對這些主題提出意見或想法感覺「難以觸及」。值得注意的是，這個團隊的一名成員在工作坊後不久改變了他們的主修為工程，並開始了他們自己的開源專案。

_“To disseminate the information anonymously, we wanted to recruit individuals to distribute the USB drives to strangers. This creates a chain of anonymous transmission, making it difficult to trace the original source. As the information spreads, individuals can add details or context, further obscuring the origin. But how do people trust each other enough to share the USB and know what to do with it?” - Pepperoni from Team Pizza_

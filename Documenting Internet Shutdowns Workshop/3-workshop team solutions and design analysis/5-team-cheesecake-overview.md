A. **Scenario:** War-like situation in Taiwan. This team chose this situation because of the topic of the workshop and the tense political relations with CCP and the constant looming threat Taiwanese face about such a possibility of being attacked by CCP.

**情境：** 台灣面臨類似戰爭的情況。團隊選擇這個情境是因為工作坊的名字以及與中國緊張的政治關係，以及台灣人面臨的持續威脅的可能性。

B. **Persona:** Journalist. The team thought they could understand and relate to the journalist more and it would be harder to imagine what the activist would need. This does highlight the basic approach of design thinking which is to be able to empathize with the users.

**角色：** 記者。團隊認為他們能比較理解和認同記者，而是面對其他像是社運的需求會比較困難。這突顯了設計思考的基本，能夠與用戶產生連結。

C. **Context:** CCP deploys military aircraft over Taiwan disrupting the internet and communications by destroying the infrastructure or blocking the signals, leaving citizens without access to news updates. Our journalist wakes up to the sound of military aircraft flying overhead. Turning on the TV, they learn that the CCP has deployed military aircraft over Taiwan, causing widespread panic. As the journalist tries to check online news sources, they realize that internet connectivity is becoming increasingly unstable. Feeling a mix of confusion and determination, they head to the news agency's office and on the way notice people on the streets looking anxious and confused, many frantically trying to use their smartphones without success. At the office, the journalist and their colleagues face a grim reality: the internet is completely down, and traditional communication channels are disrupted. They realize they need to find alternative ways to gather and disseminate crucial information to the public.

**背景：** 中共在台灣上空部署軍用飛機，通過破壞基礎設施或阻斷信號來干擾網路和通信，使民眾無法獲取資訊。
我們的記者被頭頂上飛過的軍用飛機聲驚醒。打開電視，他們得知中共已在台灣上空部署軍用飛機，引起廣泛恐慌。當記者試圖查看線上新聞時，他們意識到網路連線變得越來越不穩定。帶著困惑，他們前往新聞台的辦公室，途中注意到街上的人看起來焦慮和迷茫。在辦公室，記者和同事們面臨嚴峻的現實：網路完全中斷，傳統的通信渠道被干擾。他們意識到需要找到替代方案來收集和傳播關鍵資訊給民眾。

D. **Goal:** The journalist would want to send the correct information for the public to follow. The message is about the CCP attacking Taiwan and because the communication was shut down, there is no way to know. The other goal is to enable people to communicate with each other in a war-like scenario.

**目標：** 記者想要向民眾發送正確的信息。訊息是關於中共攻擊台灣，由於通信被切斷，沒有辦法知道具體情況。 另一個目標是使人們能夠在戰爭般的情境中相互溝通。

E. **Solution finding:** Since people are always connected to the internet at all times, disruption even for a little while can cause people to panic. Team Cheesecake thought about a similar situation where people who might be on their way somewhere in metros etc… would want to know what happened to the internet. With traditional methods unavailable, the team came up with the following solutions to leverage existing infrastructure and local community networks:

1. District leaders: Each district in Taiwan also has people(sort of a district leader) who are related to the government and take care of the common matters for the public. People could reach out to the district leader to get the right information. These district leaders are a part of many team’s solutions because they are an important and prominent part of the social structure. This also makes the solution localized to the Taiwanese region. The journalists will also go to the district leaders to get the information and relay it to the public. Since there is no internet, there needs to be an additional reliance on physical locations for the solutions. 

2. Kiosk machines: Convenience stores become hubs of information, with people gathering to read the latest updates on the bulletin boards.

3. Line app: Everyone in Taiwan has the Line app and there’s a news section(Line Today) on the app. There could be a possibility to collaborate with them to make that feature offline, or users could be allowed to receive updates by scanning QR codes at convenience store kiosks. This is where this team found interesting intersections in their ideas in an attempt to make the solutions robust.

4. Youbike: While thinking of other prevalent systems in Taiwan the team also thought of using the youbike screens to flash short important messages to the public. Since there are several youbike spots across Taiwan, it can be an innovative use of city infrastructure under dire need.

The team considers journalists to be a trusted source of information and act as a bridge for the public to understand the complex social issues. Journalists offer insights on the important things that the public should care about hence they play a crucial role in informing people about the latest happenings thereby making them a critical part of their solution. 

**解決方案:** 由於人們總是連接到網路，即使短暫的中斷也會導致人們恐慌。Team Cheesecake考慮了類似的情況，比如在地鐵等地方的人可能想知道網路怎麼了。在傳統方法不能用的情況下，團隊提出了以下解決方案，利用現有基礎設施和本地社區網絡：

1. 里長：台灣地區每個里都會有里長，負責處理公共事務。人們可以聯繫理長獲取正確資訊。里長是許多團隊都有提到的解決方案，因為他們是台灣社會結構中重要的元素。記者也會去找里長獲取資訊並轉達給公眾。由於沒有網路，解決方法需要依賴更多實體地點。

2. Kiosk：便利商店成為資訊中心，人們聚集在公告欄上閱讀最新的資訊。

3. Line APP：台灣每個人都有Line，APP中有新聞部分（Line Today）。可以考慮與他們合作使該功能離線使用，或允許用戶通過掃描便利商店的QR Code接收最新的新聞。這是團隊在研究解決方案時發現的有趣的點。

4. Youbike：在思考台灣其他普及系統時，團隊還想到使用Youbike上的螢幕向民眾顯示簡短重要信息。由於台灣各地都有幾個Youbike點，在緊急需要時可以有創意的利用城市基礎設施。
團隊認為記者是可信賴的信息來源，作為公眾理解複雜社會問題的橋樑。記者提供對公眾應該關心的重要事物的見解，因此在告知人們最新發生的事情方面發揮著至關重要的作用，從而成為他們解決方案的關鍵部分。

_“We explored leveraging LINE app's potential offline functionality. LINE is the dominant messaging app in Taiwan. LINE already has a news page called LINE Today. We wanted to utilize existing features and make important news available in critical locations, then release it through the convenience store kiosk machine for people to scan the QR code to gain the most updated information. (This function is not currently available at the convenience store nor in the LINE app). We also wanted to address the importance of authenticity in news sources. Particularly, the credibility of news sources in times of chaos.”_ **- Biscuit from Team Cheesecake**

A. **Scenario:** This team was focused on emergency communication tools in disaster scenarios where the internet is failing due to environmental destruction or heavy weather conditions. This scenario was chosen as it is a common occurrence in Taiwan due to the prevalence of Typhoons, landslides and other weather related crises as well as mountain climbing being a common activity.

**情境：** 這個團隊專注於在因環境破壞或惡劣天氣導致網路中斷的災難情況下的緊急通訊工具。選擇這個場景是因為在台灣,由於颱風、土石流和其他天氣相關危機頻繁發生,以及登山活動的普及,這是種很常見的情況。

B. **User persona:** The persona they focused on was a professional adult, climbing hobbyist who, until this disaster scenario, had not thought or prepared for a lack of communication. In this exploration the general critical user type is explored, the unprepared, regular citizen who by circumstance has been ‘pushed’ into communication cut off and is struggling with what to do.

**角色：** 他們聚焦的角色是一位專業成年人，爬山愛好者，在這個災難情境發生之前，從未考慮或準備過通訊中斷的情況。在這次討論中，我們討論了一般的關鍵使用者類型，在發展使用者旅程的過程中，討論的一般關鍵用戶是未做準備的普通民眾，他們因環境而被「推進」通訊中斷的情況，並在對外聯繫上遇到困難。

C. **Context:** The team members found that this was a user persona as well as a scenario where they could explore the topics of restricted communication, harm to people around them and decision making around what to communicate, when and to what best effect for more than one person. The topic of war-like or an international or national %E2%80%98internet shutdown%E2%80%99 was discussed in this team, but the safer option that explored similar themes was the natural disaster scenario and allowed the team to speak freely, unburdened by sensitive politics.

**背景：** 團隊成員發現這不僅是一個使用者角色，也是一個可以探索受限通訊、周圍人員受傷以及決策如何、何時、以何種方式最有效地為多人聯繫通訊的情境。團隊討論了戰爭般或國際性/全國性「網路中斷」的話題的可能性，但更安全的選擇是探討類似主題的自然天災的情境，這讓團隊能夠自由發言，不受敏感政治話題的束縛。

D. **Goal:** To use available technology when in a remote/rural location with limited internet connectivity, to contact or 'send a signal' (primarily location data) in order to coordinate rescue and/or sending new location information to those without connectivity.

**目標：** 在偏遠/鄉下地區網路連接有限的情況下，利用可用的技術聯繫或「發送信號」（主要是位置數據），以協調救援和/或向無連線的人發送新的位置的訊息。

E. **Solution finding:** The team discussed the use of hiking apps, Bluetooth, mesh networks and a known tool called Sigfox for maintaining connectivity in remote, mountain areas and also for potential urban, city settings. It isn’t common for teams exploring design ideas to come with an established idea of what technology to use as part of the scenario solution, these technologies were often brought into the team discussions by those who self-described as engineers or coders. In itself, mentioning or suggesting technologies doesn’t ‘pollute’ the design exploration at large, as the users, journeys and needs for technology solutions are still maintained in the process, but early suggestions can affect and bias the decisions the teams make. Here though, the purpose of mentioning this tech was that it was being investigated in the local tech communities in Taiwan. The ideal scenario for the teams solution was that, through a combination of a ‘back-up weak connection (either via bluetooth mesh or Sigfox) that a hiking mobile app (possibly connected to LINE, with information inputted in offline) could ‘ping’ a location of the climbers in order to either then receive or send a ‘packet’ of information of their location and status.

This led the team to discuss the importance of localizing technology to fit specific user interface expectations and needs, such as integrating with popular apps like Line, and chat functions in Taiwan. The team considers the challenges of privacy and trust in government-created technology, and the role of citizen awareness and localized solutions in ensuring the effectiveness of these tools. The trust in government administered and maintained technologies relied heavily on what government department undertook that responsibility, given that some departments were trusted more than others. Examples of this shaky trust surfaced in conversations about potential overseas surveillance cameras being bought from a Chinese owned manufacturing company as well as the digital Taiwanese citizenship cards that were resisted against.

The biggest discovery this team made as they developed their persona was around the importance of accessible and well designed training and usable technology for regular citizens. Citing that most tools that facilitate communication not using the standard internet are difficult, confusing and require a considered training approach for regular citizens.

**解決方案：** 團隊討論了使用登山程式、藍牙、無線Mesh網路,以及一種名為Sigfox 0G (Zero-G) technology 的已知工具,以在偏遠山區和可能的城市環境中保持連接。團隊通常不會預先有使用特定技術作為解決方案的想法,這些偏技術的解決方案通常是由工程師背景的成員在團隊討論中提出的。單純提及或建議技術某個特定技術本身並不會「玷污」整體的探索過程,其使用者旅程、設計思考和對技術解決方案仍然保持在過程中,但早期的建議可能會影響並對結果有所偏頗。在這裡,提到這些技術的目的是因為它們正在台灣當地的科技社群中被研究。團隊解決方案的理想情況是,通過結合網路連線較弱的通訊方式(通過藍牙網狀網路或Sigfox),登山手機應用程式(可能與LINE連接,離線輸入資訊)可以「ping」登山者的位置,以便接收或發送他們的位置和狀態的「資訊包」)。

這讓團隊衍伸出了重要的討論，將技術在地化以因應本地人對用戶界面的特定期望和需求。例如在台灣整合普遍的應用程式如Line的聊天功能。團隊討論了政府開發的App中在面對隱私安全方面的挑戰,以及民眾對政府開發的App的認識和介面的在地化，都需要被解決以確保這些在工具在操作上的實用性。取決於哪個政黨執政會影響對政府開發的App的信任度,因為有些政黨比其他政黨更受信任。這種不穩定的信任在從中國製造公司購買監控攝影機,以及遭到抵制的台灣數位身份證的討論中可見一般。隨著團隊發展他們的persona,他們最大的心得是為一般民眾打造使用者友善設計介面的重要性。他們指出,大多數政府開發的App都很難使用,還需要訓練民眾如何使用。

_“Generally Taiwanese citizens trust government-issued apps. Taiwan's V-Watch during the COVID-19 pandemic was an example. It integrated with the popular messaging app LINE, to collect vaccination data and connect the government with the local population. In emergency response situations, trust between the Taiwanese government and the public remains relatively high. However, on the topic of surveillance technology, the team were concerned with who manufactures it. If it’s made in China, there is a risk that these cameras could be used for surveillance.”_ **- Taro from Team Hotpot**

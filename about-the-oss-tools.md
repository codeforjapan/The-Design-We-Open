About Ceno

Ceno (short for Censorship.no!) is a Web browser for mobile Android devices (such as smartphones and tablets) that uses a novel approach to circumvent Internet censorship and share retrieved content among all users in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. This reduces overall reliance on international network exchanges, and allows frequently requested Web content to persist in the network even during heavy filtering and throttling events.

What sets Ceno apart from most other circumvention initiatives is that users can continue to share Web content even when no (or extremely limited) connectivity exists across national borders. Ceno is thus built in anticipation of aggressive Internet filtering and the establishment of national intranets to fence off nations from the Web.

Ceno Browser is built on an adapted version of Firefox for Android, a popular, modern, feature-rich and secure Free/Libre/Open Source browser. Ceno extends Firefox with Ouinet, the underlying technology allowing it to share content between devices (described in later sections).


About Session

Session is an end-to-end encrypted messenger that minimises sensitive metadata, designed and built for people who want absolute privacy and freedom from any form of surveillance. Session is an open-source, public-key-based secure messaging application which uses a set of decentralised storage servers and an onion routing protocol to send end-to-end encrypted mes- sages with minimal exposure of user metadata. It does this while providing the common features expected of mainstream messaging applications, such as multi-device syncing, offline inboxes, and voice/video calling.


About Cofacts
